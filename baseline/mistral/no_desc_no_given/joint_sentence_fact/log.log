His recalcitrance to the Soviet ideological pressure cost him life : he was executed during the Great Purge and his writings were banned for nearly twenty years . In the words of the modern British scholar of Russian and Georgian literature , Donald Rayfield , " his vivid story - telling , straight in medias res , his buoyant humour , subtle irony , and moral courage merit comparison with those of Stendhal , Guy de Maupassant , and Émile Zola .

A turf war between rival drug cartels for control of the lake began in March 2010 and has led to a series of armed robberies and shooting incidents . All of the attacks were credited to the Los Zetas cartel and occurred primarily on the Mexican side of the reservoir but within sight of the Texas coast .

It has been recognized as the first modern detective story ; Poe referred to it as one of his " tales of ratiocination " . C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mystery of the brutal murder of two women . Numerous witnesses heard a suspect , though no one agrees on what language was spoken . At the murder scene , Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human . As the first fictional detective , Poe 's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives , including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot . Many later characters , for example , follow Poe 's model of the brilliant detective , his personal friend who serves as narrator , and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it . Dupin himself reappears in " The Mystery of Marie Rogêt " and " The Purloined Letter " .

To this end , Good sought to write songs that could best be conveyed to live audiences . In fact , many of the record 's tracks ( including " Little Terror " , " North American for Life " , " Blue Skies Over Bad Lands " , " It 's Been A While Since I Was Your Man " , and " Ex - Pats of the Blue Mountain Symphony Orchestra " ) were written and performed live , well in advance of the album 's release .

He is known in Italy as the " Iron Prefect " ( Prefetto di Ferro ) because of his iron - fisted campaigns against the Mafia in Sicily in the second half of the 1920s . He is widely regarded as a fascist , even though at the beginning of Italy 's fascist dictatorship he arrested both fascists and socialists when he was prefect of Bologna . He officially joined the Fascist National Party only in 1926 . He was probably an officer who did n't have any strong political beliefs and who exhibited courage , dedication and integrity in the defense of the state and its institutions especially in combating the Mafia in Sicily . Nonetheless , the fight against the Mafia carried out by Cesare Mori proved to be effective mainly due to the special powers granted to him by Benito Mussolini when he was prefect in Sicily .

In the two decades following its release , Benny often exploited the film 's failure for laughs in his popular radio and television comedy series The Jack Benny Program , making the film a well - known entity to his wide audience , even if they had never seen it . The Horn Blows At Midnight would prove to be Benny 's final starring feature , although he would continue as a radio and TV star ( as well as making cameo appearances in films ) for years afterwards . The Horn Blows At Midnight had the misfortune to be released only eight days after the death of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . This may have contributed to its poor reception , although the film 's negative reviews ( often alluded in jokes mentioning the production ) might have also impacted it , as the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel , also dealing with the afterlife , opened on Broadway at roughly the same time and became a hit .

Dreyfus joined a small textile trading firm set up by three of his elder brothers and moved to Lima , Peru to act as their local representative . He became involved in the guano trade , and in 1869 signed a major contract with the Peruvian government that gave him a monopoly over exports of Peruvian guano to Europe . With this he controlled the largest source of Peruvian national income . The Peruvian government let Dreyfus act as their agent in managing their existing debt and floating new loans used for railway construction . The government ran into increasing financial difficulties . These were compounded by a war with Chile between 1879 and 1883 in which they lost their key guano - producing province . A lengthy series of lawsuits followed between the creditors whose loans were secured by guano deposits and the governments of Peru and Chile . The Dreyfus trading enterprise came to an end . He retired to France , where he owned a chateau in the country and a mansion in Paris that he filled with a major collection of art .

The Bible claims that the Gershonites were all descended from the eponymous Gershon , a son of Levi , although some biblical scholars regard this as a postdictional metaphor providing an aetiology of the connectedness of the clan to others in the Israelite confederation . The Bible ascribes a specific religious function to the Gershonites , namely care of the curtains , hangings , and ropes of the sanctuary . This differentiation of religious activity between the Gershonites and other Levites , in particular the Aaronids , is found only in the Priestly Code , and not in passages that textual scholars attribute to other authors .

Stylistically and structurally experimental , the novel follows the development of human society into the 27th century and depicts global - scale conflicts between future polities , technologies , and natural forces , culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland 's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland 's ice cap . Among critics , Berge Meere und Giganten has the reputation of being a difficult and polarizing novel , and has not received nearly as much attention as Döblin 's following novel , Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) . Inspired by the mundane sight of pebbles rolling in the Baltic Sea surf in the summer of 1921 , Döblin began writing Berge Meere und Giganten that fall , conducting extensive research into various natural and human sciences in the process . Although he had originally conceived of it as a hymn to the city and technology , over the course of writing the novel it evolved into a tribute to the power of nature . He finished the manuscript in the summer of 1923 , and it was published by Fischer Verlag the following year .

The program was initiated by 1945 , at which time ca . 5 % of the 2.7 million toll board calls per day were handled by this method . Operator Toll Dialing eliminated the need for intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices . Initially this system involved step - by - step routings to set up each circuit , but later was improved by the development of area codes with machine translation which helped to standardize dialing across the network . The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946 . In 1947 , the North American Numbering Plan for area codes was set up . Operator Toll DIaling was gradually superseded by Direct Distance Dialing ( DDD ) , in which the customer dialed the area code as well as the number . Beginning in 1951 on a limited basis , it was not fully implemented until the 1970s . Telephone administrations in other countries implemented similar programs , such as in the United Kingdom , which led to Subscriber Trunk Dialling ( STD ) .

Singing was also employed as a recreational activity but as a release from the inevitable tensions that come with fighting in a war , particularly a war in which the issue of freedom of a race is to be decided . In camp , music was a diversion away from the bloodshed , helping the soldiers deal with homesickness and boredom . Soldiers of both sides often engaged in recreation with musical instruments , and when the opposing armies were near each other , sometimes the bands from both sides of the conflict played against each other on the night before a battle . Each side had its particular favorite tunes , while some music was enjoyed by Northerners and Southerners alike , as exemplified by United States President Abraham Lincoln 's love of Dixie , the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy .

The front cover of the CD has the title Live at Town Hall , New York City September 19–20 , 2001 , however the official title of the album is just Live in New York . Recorded less than 10 days after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on New York City , the album was produced during a tour Anderson gave of the United States in which she performed a mixture of older pieces from earlier in her career and newer works , including songs from her then - recent album Life on a String , as well as earlier albums such as United States Live , Big Science , Bright Red , Home of the Brave and Strange Angels . Following so close to the attacks , Anderson makes several statements about them in her recognizable style . The performance is highlighted by a performance of " O Superman , " the song that launched Anderson to stardom in 1981 and that contains lyrics that can — in retrospect — be seen to relate to the terrorist attacks . One song , " Progress " , is a retitled performance of the song " The Dream Before " which Anderson debuted in her 1986 short film What You Mean We ? and later featured on Strange Angels .

He was also politically active as a communist making significant contributions , both graphic and theoretical to Die Aktion . Seiwert was born in Cologne . He was seriously burned in 1901 , at the age of seven , in an experimental radiological treatment . As a result , he subsequently lived with the fear that his life would be short . He studied from 1910 to 1914 at the Cologne School of Arts and Crafts . In 1919 he met Max Ernst and took part in Dada activities . He was invited to exhibit in the large Dada exhibit in Cologne but withdrew at the last moment . In that same year he formed the Stupid group which included Heinrich Hoerle and Anton Räderscheidt . According to Ernst , " Stupid was a secession from Cologne Dada . As far as Hoerle and especially Seiwert were concerned , Dada 's activities were aesthetically too radical and socially not concrete enough " . His first large solo exhibition was in Cologne at the Kunstverein in 1923 , and by the mid-1920s he was a leader of the " Group of Progressive Artists " , who sought to reconcile constructivism with realism while expressing radical political views . In 1929 he founded the magazine " a - z " , a journal of progressive art . This became a vehicle for the exposition of Figurative Constructivism .

The vessel was constructed in 1922 , in Whitehorse , by the British Yukon Navigation Company , a subsidiary of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway company . For most of its career it transported silver , zinc and lead ore down the Stewart River from mines in the Mayo district to the confluence of the Yukon and Stewart rivers at Stewart City . It was retired from commercial service in 1951 due to the extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway in the years after World War II . Following its withdrawal from service the SS Keno was laid up at the BYN Co. shipyard in Whitehorse , before being selected for preservation and donated by the company to the Canadian Government in 1959 . On 25 August 1960 the Keno left Whitehorse to sail downstream to Dawson City . In doing so she became the last of the Yukon 's sternwheeler steamers to navigate the Yukon River under her own power . Three days later she arrived in Dawson and was subsequently installed as a tourist attraction and a permanent memorial to the approximately 250 sternwheelers that provided a vital transport service on the Yukon River and its tributaries during the latter half of the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries .

Its ruins lie near the modern city of Antakya , Turkey , and lends the modern city its name . Antioch was founded near the end of the fourth century BC by Seleucus I Nicator , one of Alexander the Great 's generals . The city 's geographical , military , and economic location benefited its occupants , particularly such features as the spice trade , the Silk Road , and the Royal Road . It eventually rivaled Alexandria as the chief city of the Near East . It was also the main center of Hellenistic Judaism at the end of the Second Temple period . Most of the urban development of Antioch occurred during the Roman Empire , when the city was one of the most important in the eastern Mediterranean area of Rome 's dominions . Antioch was called " the cradle of Christianity " as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity . The Christian New Testament asserts that the name " Christian " first emerged in Antioch . It was one of the four cities of the Syrian tetrapolis , and its residents were known as Antiochenes . The city was a metropolis of half a million people during Augustan times , but it declined to relative insignificance during the Middle Ages because of warfare , repeated earthquakes , and a change in trade routes , which no longer passed through Antioch from the far east following the Mongol invasions and conquests .

Later that year , Thomas Jefferson initiated the tradition of Marine Band performances by requesting that it perform at his inauguration . The Marine Band has played at every United States presidential inauguration since . President Thomas Jefferson gave the title " The President 's Own " in 1801 .

It has several translation problems that make the game difficult to understand in English . The player starts as a character named " Hacker " who is just as the name implies . The player starts with a pistol and the ability to hack certain objects ( ATM 's , Trade Robots , etc . ) as well as a journal which gives maps of the area and tells them missions both current and completed . As certain missions are completed , the character 's level will increase and skills can have points added to them increasing areas like strength , aim , hacking skill , health points and so forth . The game offers the option to play solo or to join with other characters or groups ( such as the mob ) . Hacker is constantly hunted by the law making teaming up with someone in the best interest of the player 's survival . Teaming up will also add new missions to Hacker 's journal . Additional weapons , items , and body armor can be acquired by purchase or by killing another player . The character 's strength determines what weight of weapons , items etc . he can carry while certain clothing will increase or decrease the number of items they can carry . The heavier the weight , the less distance the character can move in a given turn . As strength and level increase , so will a character 's distance he can travel .

The conflict pitted three forces against one another : the Rhodesian government , led by Ian Smith ( later the Zimbabwe - Rhodesian government of Bishop Abel Muzorewa ) ; the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army , the military wing of Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe African National Union ; and the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army of Joshua Nkomo 's Zimbabwe African People 's Union . The war and its subsequent Internal Settlement , signed in 1978 by Smith and Muzorewa , led to the implementation of universal suffrage in June 1979 and the end of white minority rule in Rhodesia , which was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia under a black majority government . However , this new order failed to win international recognition and the war continued . Neither side achieved a military victory and a compromise was later reached . Negotiations between the government of Zimbabwe - Rhodesia , the UK Government and Mugabe and Nkomo 's united " Patriotic Front " took place at Lancaster House , London in December 1979 , and the Lancaster House Agreement was signed . The country returned temporarily to British control and new elections were held under British and Commonwealth supervision in March 1980 .

The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third .

Her first official release after her former band Hole 's break - up , the album 's sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole 's three previous studio albums : Pretty on the Inside ( 1991 ) , Live Through This ( 1994 ) and Celebrity Skin ( 1998 ) . The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles , California , however , was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems , the disbandment of Hole , the controversy surrounding Nirvana 's upcoming box set , and legal problems with various record labels . In spring 2003 , Love traveled to southern France to re - record the album , however , according to Love , she " just wanted to be in a château for six months and do drugs . " The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time . Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing . Upon its release , it received little promotion , with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album 's first single , " Mono , " and Love 's highly publicised drug issues . America 's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure , selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States , and with Love further citing the album as " a mistake . " In more recent years , both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as " le disaster " and " ruined because [ Love ] was coked out , " respectively . The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel , as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn .

Consistent with the supercontinent cycle , Pangaea Ultima could occur within the next 250 million years . This potential configuration , hypothesized by Christopher Scotese , earned its name from its similarity to the previous Pangaea supercontinent . Scotese later renamed Pangaea Ultima ( Last Pangaea ) to Pangaea Proxima ( Next Pangaea ) to alleviate confusion about the name Pangaea Ultima which could imply that it would be the last supercontinent . The concept was based on examination of past cycles of formation and breakup of supercontinents , not on current understanding of the mechanisms of tectonic change , which are too imprecise to project that far into the future . " It 's all pretty much fantasy to start with , " Scotese has said . " But it 's a fun exercise to think about what might happen . And you can only do it if you have a really clear idea of why things happen in the first place . " Supercontinents describe the merger of all , or nearly all , of the Earth 's landmass into a single contiguous continent . In the Pangaea Ultima scenario , subduction at the western Atlantic , east of the Americas , leads to the subduction of the Atlantic mid - ocean ridge followed by subduction destroying the Atlantic and Indian basin , causing the Atlantic and Indian Oceans to close , bringing the Americas back together with Africa and Europe . As with most supercontinents , the interior of Pangaea Proxima would probably become a semi - arid desert prone to extreme temperatures .

The book is a critique of the past forty years of the Republican coalition in United States politics . He " presents a nightmarish vision of ideological extremism , catastrophic fiscal irresponsibility , rampant greed , and dangerous shortsightedness . " Phillips points to three unifying themes holding this coalition together . First , its tie to oil and the role oil plays in American and world events . Second , to the coalition of social conservatives , Evangelicals and Pentecostals in this Republican coalition . Finally , he points to the " debt culture " of this coalition , and to a coming " debt bubble " related to the debt of the U.S. Government and U.S. consumers . He argues that similar issues have been prevalent in the past , when other world powers , such as the Roman Empire and the British Empire declined from their peaks and fell into disarray . While working as a strategist in the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon , Phillips wrote The Emerging Republican Majority . In that book , Phillips predicted the formation of this very coalition that he criticizes in his current book . In American Theocracy he admits that while these " mutations , " as he calls them , could have been predicted , he did not foresee the extent to which they would develop and dominate the coalition he helped put together . The last chapter of this book references his first work , and is called " The Erring Republican Majority . "

This was the second occasion on which a song had been performed with lyrics in an invented language - Belgium having entered Sanomi by Urban Trad at the 2003 Contest . The song is an up - tempo number , with many influences from African and flamenco music . The lyrics explain that " There is a way / To understand without a language " , in keeping with the musical theme of exuberant joy in spite of an apparently insurmountable language barrier . The title was the cause of much confusion prior to the Contest , with the official CD of entries titling the track " Amanbanda " ( with an " n " instead of an " m " ) . BBC commentary referred to the song as " Amamdangda " briefly , as well as describing the group as " a mother and her two daughters " , which was also incorrect as Caroline Hoffman was not the mother of the two van Dijk sisters , though this comment was sarcastic and not taken as literal by listeners . As the Netherlands had not finished the 2005 Contest in the top 10 , the song was performed in the semi - final . Here , it was performed seventeenth , following Finland 's Lordi with " Hard Rock Hallelujah " and preceding Lithuania 's LT United with " We Are The Winners " . At the close of voting , it had received 22 points , placing 20th in a field of 23 and thus missing out on the final and requiring the Netherlands to qualify from the semi - final at the next Contest . Immediately following this result , rumours began to circulate that the Netherlands would opt out of the next Contest . These rumours were , however , proven to be untrue as the country began qualification for the 2007 Contest . It was succeeded as Dutch representative at the 2007 Contest by Edsilia Rombley with " On Top of the World " .

His imprisonment drew protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International , the latter of which named him a prisoner of conscience . Michá was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea ( PPGE ) , a banned political party opposing the long - dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea . In late March 2008 , he was arrested without a warrant . Within a week , fellow PPGE activists Cruz Obiang Ebele , Gumersindo Ramírez Faustino , Juan Ecomo Ndong , Gerardo Angüe Mangue , and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested . Michá was held for two months at the police station , turning which time he was allegedly tortured . In May 2008 , the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist , Saturnino Ncogo . Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances . Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide , but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition , and no investigation was ever conducted . According to Amnesty International , the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo 's home and the statements the six had made under duress ; in addition , the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them . Despite being charged with unrelated crimes , the six were tried alongside Simon Mann , a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt . The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece . The US State Department considers Michá a political prisoner , and has objected to his continued imprisonment . Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience , and has called for his immediate release .

Indigenous peoples are understood to be people whose historical and current territory has become occupied by colonial expansion , or the formation of a state by a dominant group such as a colonial power . While the concept of genocide was formulated by Raphael Lemkin in the mid-20th century , the earlier expansion of various European colonial powers such as the Spanish and British empires , and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory , frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas , Australia , Africa and Asia . According to Lemkin , colonization was in itself " intrinsically genocidal " . He saw this genocide as a two - stage process , the first being the destruction of the indigenous population 's way of life . In the second stage , the newcomers impose their way of life on the indigenous group . According to David Maybury - Lewis , imperial and colonial forms of genocide are enacted in two main ways , either through the deliberate clearing of territories of their original inhabitants in order to make them exploitable for purposes of resource extraction or colonial settlements , or through enlisting indigenous peoples as forced laborers in colonial or imperialist projects of resource extraction . The designation of specific events as genocidal is often controversial . Some scholars , among them Lemkin , have argued that cultural genocide , sometimes called ethnocide , should also be recognized . A people may continue to exist , but if they are prevented from perpetuating their group identity by prohibitions against cultural and religious practices that are the basis of that identity , this may also be considered a form of genocide . Examples include the treatment of Tibetans by the Chinese government and Native Americans by the US government .

After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg , Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen . Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats , Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse , resulting in disease , malnutrition , and privation for the Japanese soldiers . Meanwhile , the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate , particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea . Australian and Papuan troops advanced along the coast of the Huon Peninsula , using infantry , tanks , and air strikes against the Japanese positions , which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle . The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery , which was liberally employed in the early stages of the operation . Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour , the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced , ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor . Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed ; thousands more died from disease , malnutrition , exhaustion and suicide . The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces . During the advance , Australian troops captured Japanese cryptographic materials . This had an important effect on the subsequent course of the war against Japan in the South West Pacific , as it permitted codebreakers in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously .

These twelve ships were the last United States destroyer class completed prior to the American entry into World War II . All Sims - class ships saw action in World War II , and seven survived the war . No ship of this class saw service after 1946 . They were built under the Second London Naval Treaty , in which the limit on destroyer standard displacement was lifted , but an overall limit remained . Thus , to maximize the number of destroyers and avoid developing an all - new design , the Sims class were only 70 tons larger as designed than previous destroyers . They are usually grouped with the 1500-ton classes and were the sixth destroyer class since production resumed with the Farragut class in 1932 . The class served extensively in World War II , and five of the class were lost in the war . Of the five ships lost , four were at the hands of the Japanese and one at the hands of the Germans . The class served on Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic in 1940 - 41 . Except for Roe , Wainwright , and Buck , the class was transferred to the Pacific shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor . All of the ships saw extensive combat service . At the war 's end in August 1945 , three of the seven survivors were undergoing overhauls that were left unfinished , and were ultimately scrapped . The remaining four seaworthy ships were used as targets during the 1946 Operation Crossroads atomic tests at Bikini Atoll . One was sunk by the first blast , while the other three were sunk as targets two years later after serving as experimental platforms .

mistral_joint_sentence_fact:  10%|▉         | 2/21 [03:03<26:22, 83.30s/it] sentence:  Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball , and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League . In 2000 , the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities , and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner 's office . Since that time , MLB has operated as a single league , and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States . It is composed of 30 teams . The First - Year Player Draft , also known as the Rule 4 Draft , is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools , colleges , and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams . The first draft took place in 1965 ; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top - level prospects and therefore , monopolizing the player market . Originally , three drafts were held each year . The first draft took place in June and involved high - school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons . The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December . The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues . The August draft was eliminated after two years , and the January draft lasted until 1986 . The draft order is determined based on the previous season 's standings , with the team possessing the worst record receiving the first pick . In addition , teams that lost free agents in the previous off - season may be awarded " compensatory " picks .

Sculpted by Pietro da Salò in the 16th century , the statue takes the form of a crouching , naked hunchback supporting a small flight of steps . According to the writings of Stefano Magno it was unveiled on 16 November 1541 and was used as a podium for official proclamations : the statutes of Venice or the names of offenders would be proclaimed by an official standing on the block at the same time as they were read out at Pietra del Bando near Piazza San Marco . It was also used as the finishing point for a punishment for minor misdemeanours ; the guilty party would be stripped naked and made to run the gauntlet of citizens lining the streets from Piazza San Marco to the Rialto , saving themselves further humiliation by kissing the statue . By the 19th century , time had taken its toll on the statue and , in 1836 , it was restored with funds provided by the civic authorities . The block above the hunchback 's head now bears a Latin inscription with the date of the restoration . It is said to communicate with the Pasquino , one of the talking statues of Rome . From the early 16th century the Pasquino , a statue of a torso , was used as an agent for critical commentaries against the Pope and the authorities : satirical notes would be attached anonymously to the base of the statue purporting to come from the Pasquino himself . Other statues in Rome would be used to fulfill a similar purpose and establish a dialogue . In the 17th century the Pasquino exchanged correspondence with Il Gobbo concerning the Republic of Venice , Pope Paul V and the writings of Cardinals Baronio and Bellarmino . The characters of Launcelot Gobbo and his father , Old Gobbo , in William Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice may have been inspired by this traditional symbol of the Rialto .

An arena rock and gothic rock song , " Long Hard Road Out of Hell " was written by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez and produced by Manson and Sean Beavan . Its lyrics are about self - loathing and its title is derived from John Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) . After the track was written , the Sneaker Pimps ' Kelli Ali was recruited to perform background vocals on it , as the Spawn soundtrack featured collaborations between hard rock artists and electronic music artists . The Sneaker Pimps were dissatisfied with the final track and wanted a remix of it to be released as a single instead ; conversely , Manson deemed it a personal favorite . " Long Hard Road Out of Hell " received mixed reviews from music critics ; some found it heartfelt while others felt it was too indistinct from other Marilyn Manson songs . Commentators noted that the track encapsulated the evolution of the band 's sound from the industrial music of Antichrist Superstar ( 1996 ) to the glam rock of Mechanical Animals ( 1998 ) . Manson initially approached Jonathan Glazer to direct the video for the track , but rejected his concept for it ; Glazer later used his concept for the video for Radiohead 's " Karma Police " ( 1997 ) . The music video for " Long Hard Road Out of Hell " was directed by Matthew Rolston . It depicts Manson in a dress and a group of models who initially appear to be female but are revealed to be male . The clip garnerd acclaim from critics for its imagery .

She promoted gender equality , dress reform , birth control , and male and female sexual fulfillment for successful marriages . A well - traveled and well - read person who counted among her friends Leo Tolstoy and Havelock Ellis , she also visited Sweden and from her trips to schools there she brought back the idea of teaching children domestic crafts , thus single - handedly establishing shop and home economics classes in the United States . Stockham lectured against the use of corsets by women , made public endorsements of the healthiness of masturbation for both men and women ( still controversial when echoed by U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders more than 100 years later ) , advocated complete abstinence from alcohol and tobacco , and believed in women 's rights . Stockham was very concerned with the economic plight of divorced women with children and prostitutes who wanted to get off the street . She felt that these women had no marketable skills and would be unable to support themselves , so she had copies of her book Tokology , a layperson 's guide to gynecology and midwifery , privately printed and gave them to " unfortunate women " to sell door - to - door in Chicago . Each copy came with a bound - in certificate signed by Stockham and entitling the bearer to a free gynecological exam . In 1905 , a then 72-year old Stockham and her publisher were convicted of circulating improper literature under the Comstock laws .

It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force the closure of the Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute , with the loss of approximately 200 jobs . Westfield , who owned a nearby shopping centre , had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre , which was operating on land not zoned for this purpose . When the courts ruled in Westfield 's favor , Liverpool City Council sought State Government approval for a retrospective rezoning , to validate its earlier decision to approve the shopping centre . The State Government declined to intervene , despite a planning report suggesting that course of action , and the retail component of the Orange Grove centre was forced to close . The bulky goods component of the centre remained open , as the centre was legally zoned for bulky goods sales . However , the state Opposition subsequently unearthed information about a meeting between Premier Bob Carr 's chief of staff and a prominent Westfield employee , sparking allegations that interference from Westfield had played a role in the government 's decision not to intervene . As a result , a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned , and the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an investigation . The investigation concluded in 2005 , with no findings of corruption against any person . However , the Commission recommended that the NSW Government strengthen guidelines for public servants dealing with corruption allegations by lobbyists . Unlike Nick Greiner in 1992 and Barry O'Farrell in 2014 , the Orange Grove affair marked the only time that a sitting Premier in Bob   Carr had survived appearing before ICAC although Carr did retire mere months after the conclusion of ICAC 's investigation of the Orange Grove affair .

The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the British - governed colony . Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada in 1815 . His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government , and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions , essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration . To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the British House of Commons , the Parti patriote had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people . On February 28 , 1834 , Papineau presented the Ninety - Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to London . The resolutions included , among other things , demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives . Under the Constitutional Act of 1791 , the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly , but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony . In the resolutions , the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown , but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony . Papineau 's resolutions were ignored for almost three years ; meanwhile , the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un - elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion . British Colonial Secretary Lord Russell eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own ( the Russell Resolutions ) . All of the Legislative Assembly 's demands were rejected . The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837 , and many of Papineau 's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion . See the Lower Canada Rebellion .

This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices : leader ( imam ) of the congregational prayer , which in larger mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers ; and preacher ( khatib ) of the sermon or khutba at the required congregational prayer on Friday . Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation , at most well - established mosques imam khatib is a permanent ( part - time or full - time ) position . He may be elected by the local community , or appointed by an outside authority — e . g. , the national government , or the waqf which sustains the mosque . There is no ordination as such ; the only requirement for appointment as an imam khatib is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis , and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam . Similar to spiritual leaders , the imam khatib is the one who leads Islamic worship services . More often , the community turns to the mosque imam if they have a religious question . In smaller communities , an imam could also be the community leader . The term is not to be confused with the use of Imams of Shi'a Islam , where it has a meaning more central to belief , referring to main leaders of the Shi'a community . The term imam is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam , often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni madhhabs , or schools of jurisprudence ( fiqh ) . It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to Hadith or it may refer to the heads of the Prophet Muhammad 's family in their generational times . In other words , Imam Ali , referring to Ali ibn Abi Talib , is a phrase commonly used by both Shi'a and Sunni Muslims , though with different connotations . Those who are considered imams in the context of scholarly authority by Sunni Muslims , are listed below :

Taking place on the third anniversary of the revolution , it was directed by Nikolai Evreinov and was subtitled a " mass action . " The sets were designed by Yuri Annenkov . The spectacle was staged outside the former Tsarist Winter Palace where the Provisional Government was meeting at the time of the Bolshevik revolution . Its performers included 125 ballet dancers , 100 circus people , 1,750 supernumeraries and students , 200 women , 260 secondary actors , and 150 assistants . There were also tanks and armoured cars involved . The mass spectacle form took the pre - revolutionary Symbolist utopias of " ritual theatre " ( whose formulation was largely a response to the abortive 1905 revolution ) , and recast their " people " as the proletariat . Performed on 7 November before 100,000 spectators , the action begins with the February Revolution , follows the gradual organization of the workers ( on a red stage to the left , with Kerensky and the Provisional Government on a white stage to the right ) , until they are illuminated fully by searchlights , and crying " Lenin , Lenin " charge over the arch which joins the two stages to do battle with the " Whites . " Kerensky leaps to a car for an escape , and is pursued along a path between the two large groups of spectators by trucks full of the Red Guard waving bayonets , to the Palace . Silhouettes struggle in the windows of the Palace , until the Red Army is finally successful , and red lights flash out .

This compound title is merely a common combination of two elementary offices : leader ( imam ) of the congregational prayer , which in larger mosques is performed at the times of all daily prayers ; and preacher ( khatib ) of the sermon or khutba at the required congregational prayer on Friday . Although either duty can be performed by anyone who is regarded as qualified by the congregation , at most well - established mosques imam khatib is a permanent ( part - time or full - time ) position . He may be elected by the local community , or appointed by an outside authority — e . g. , the national government , or the waqf which sustains the mosque . There is no ordination as such ; the only requirement for appointment as an imam khatib is recognition as someone of sufficient learning and virtue to perform both duties on a regular basis , and to instruct the congregation in the basics of Islam . Similar to spiritual leaders , the imam khatib is the one who leads Islamic worship services . More often , the community turns to the mosque imam if they have a religious question . In smaller communities , an imam could also be the community leader . The term is not to be confused with the use of Imams of Shi'a Islam , where it has a meaning more central to belief , referring to main leaders of the Shi'a community . The term imam is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam , often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni madhhabs , or schools of jurisprudence ( fiqh ) . It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to Hadith or it may refer to the heads of the Prophet Muhammad 's family in their generational times . In other words , Imam Ali , referring to Ali ibn Abi Talib , is a phrase commonly used by both Shi'a and Sunni Muslims , though with different connotations .

Many authors consider Anna Karenina the greatest work of literature ever written , and Tolstoy himself called it his first true novel . It was initially released in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger . A complex novel in eight parts , with more than a dozen major characters , it is spread over more than 800 pages ( depending on the translation ) , typically contained in two volumes . It deals with themes of betrayal , faith , family , marriage , Imperial Russian society , desire , and rural vs. city life . The plot centers on an extramarital affair between Anna and dashing cavalry officer Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky that scandalizes the social circles of Saint Petersburg and forces the young lovers to flee for Italy in a futile search for happiness . Returning to Russia , their lives further unravel . A second major plot line follows Levin , a character loosely based on Tolstoy himself , who rejects glitzy city life and those same social circles for his rural farm , but struggles with both his love for Kitty , who has rejected him , and with his Christian faith . Trains are a recurring motif throughout the novel , which takes place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia , with several major plot points taking place either on passenger trains or at stations in Saint Petersburg or elsewhere in Russia . The novel has been adapted into various media including opera , film , television , ballet , figure skating and radio drama . The first film adaptation was released in 1911 but has not survived .

The earliest surviving iron artifacts , from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt , were made from meteoritic iron - nickel . It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began , but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from Sub - Saharan Africa to China . The use of wrought iron ( worked iron ) was known by the 1st millennium BC , and its spread marked the Iron Age . During the medieval period , means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron ( in this context known as pig iron ) using finery forges . For all these processes , charcoal was required as fuel . Steel ( with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron ) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy . Its process of production , Wootz steel , was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China , Africa , the Middle East and Europe . Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th - century BC China . New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century . During the Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel , creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age . In the late 1850s , Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process , that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon , and so to produce mild steel . This and other 19th - century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron . Today , wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale , having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel . The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna , Norrbotten County , Lapland . The mine which is owned by Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB , a large Swedish mining company , has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of iron ore .

The document specifically states that it is aimed at bishops , priests , religious and other pastoral workers in hopes of pastoral caregivers paying greater attention to expressions of human mobility . The document derived some of its material from the Old Testament , the New Testament , the American Automobile Association , and statements by Popes Pius XII , John XXIII , Paul VI and John Paul II . On its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of Ten Commandments for Drivers . In essence , the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component . The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences . The problem is not as pervasive in the Vatican City itself , which has a speed limit of 30   km / h ( 18 - 19   mph ) and approximately only 1000 cars ; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century , and the Vatican is responding . In the same section of the document as the Drivers ' Ten Commandments are the so - called Christian virtues of drivers , which include prudence , justice and hope . The Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road , but also address prostitution , caring for street children and the homeless , found in Parts Two , Three and Four of the Guidelines . The Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers , which leads to road rage , rude gestures , speeding , drinking behind the wheel , cursing , blasphemy , impoliteness , and intentional violation of the highway code . The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code , pray behind the wheel and recite the rosary , which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver 's attention .

A noted expert in military studies , he was known by a nickname that became derogatory : " Old Brains . " He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer . Halleck served as General - in - Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War . Early in the Civil War , Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater . He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862 , during which time , while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back , the troops under Halleck 's command won many important victories . However , Halleck was not present at the battles , and his subordinates earned most of the recognition . The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862 , a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution . Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals , such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell . In July 1862 , following Major General George B. McClellan 's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater , Halleck was promoted to general - in - chief of all U.S. armies . Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half . Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick , aggressive action . He was a master of administration , logistics , and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy , but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington , D.C. His subordinates frequently criticized him and at times ignored his instructions . President Abraham Lincoln once described him as " little more than a first rate clerk . " In March 1864 , Grant was promoted to general - in - chief , and Halleck was relegated to chief - of - staff . Without the pressure of having to control the movements of the armies , Halleck performed capably in this task , ensuring that the Union armies were well - equipped .

It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922 , Joyce 's 40th birthday . It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called " a demonstration and summation of the entire movement " . According to Declan Kiberd , " Before Joyce , no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking " . Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day , 16 June 1904 . Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus , the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey , and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel , with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus , Molly Bloom and Penelope , and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus , in addition to events and themes of the early 20th - century context of modernism , Dublin , and Ireland 's relationship to Britain . The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature . Since its publication , the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny , ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 , to protracted textual " Joyce Wars " . The novel 's stream - of - consciousness technique , careful structuring , and experimental prose — replete with puns , parodies , and allusions — as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour , have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday .

Ten Bantustans were established in South Africa , and then in neighbouring South West Africa ( then under South African administration ) , for the purpose of concentrating the members of designated ethnic groups , thus making each of those territories ethnically homogeneous as the basis for creating " autonomous " nation states for South Africa 's different black ethnic groups . The term was first used in the late 1940s and was coined from Bantu ( meaning " people " in some of the Bantu languages ) and -stan ( a suffix meaning " land " in the Persian language and some Persian - influenced languages of western , central , and southern Asia ) . It was regarded as a disparaging term by some critics of the apartheid - era government 's " homelands " ( from Afrikaans tuisland ) . The word " bantustan " , today , is often used in a pejorative sense when describing a region that lacks any real legitimacy , consists of several unconnected enclaves , or emerges from national or international gerrymandering . Four of the South African Bantustans — Transkei , Bophuthatswana , Venda , and Ciskei ( the so - called " TBVC States")—were declared independent , but this was not recognised outside South Africa . Other South African Bantustans ( like KwaZulu , Lebowa , and QwaQwa ) received partial autonomy but were never granted independence . In South West Africa , Ovamboland , Kavangoland , and East Caprivi were granted self - determination . The Bantustans were abolished with the end of apartheid and re - joined South Africa proper in 1994 .

Her actual name was Jiang Caipin ( 江采蘋 ) , originally called Consort Jiang . After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum - Blossom flowers ( the flower is pronounced as mei in Chinese ) , Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei . Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi , an eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong , to become one of Emperor Xuanzong 's concubines in his harem . As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines , she soon obtained Xuanzong 's favors . To express the favors towards Consort Mei , Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum - Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest . Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan , and swore that he would never change his heart for her . However , in 737 , after the death of Consort Wu , another favorite concubine of Xuanzong , Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan - the wife of prince Li Mao , Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most " irresistible " . Being curious , Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty . Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter - in - law ( as she was Li Mao 's wife ) , emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun , after a brief moment , Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei ( with Guifei being the highest rank for imperial consorts ) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife . Yuhuan became Xuanzong 's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu 's death . His favors towards Consort Mei also waned .

The first part of the surreal plot centers on the experiences of a prostitute in Buenos Aires , Argentina ; the second part takes place after her death . The characters include María ( and , after her death , the Shadow of María ) , a singer of payadas ; various members of the Buenos Aires underworld ; a payador who functions as a poet and narrator ; a goblin - like duende ; several marionettes under the control of the duende ; a circus of psychoanalysts ; pasta makers ; and construction workers . Many elements of the libretto suggest parallels between María and Mary , the mother of Jesus ( in Spanish , María ) or Jesus himself . While certainly not in the narrow sense an opera ballet , because the dance is tango rather than classical ballet , it falls within the tradition of having set dance pieces integral to an operatic work . The music draws on the nuevo tango idiom for which Piazzolla is famous . The original idea for the story was conceived by Piazzolla 's lover at the time of its composition , Egle Martin , who was married to Eduardo " Lalo " Palacios . The title role was originally conceived for Martin , but while Piazzolla was still composing the operita , he and Martin broke up after he asked her husband for her hand at Christmas in 1967 . According to Martin , Piazzolla said to Lalo , " She is music , she ca n't belong to anybody , no she is music , she is music , and that 's me . " After their rift , a replacement was desperately needed , but Piazzolla soon met folksinger Amelita Baltar at the Buenos Aires nightclub Nuestro Tiempo , formerly known as " 676 " and once Piazzolla 's home base in Argentina . Baltar 's identification with the character María , paired with her beauty and captivating stage presence , made her ideal for the role . The piece is written for at least three vocalists ( one of whom , the narrator , mainly speaks rather sings ) . For the orchestration Piazzolla augmented his current working quintet : Piazzolla ( bandoneón ) , Antonio Agri ( violin ) , Jamie " El Russo " Gosis ( piano ) , Oscar Lopez Ruiz ( guitar ) and Kicho Díaz ( double bass ) ; with viola , cello , flute , percussion , vibraphone and xylophone , and a second guitar . María de Buenos Aires has often been performed with dancers as well as musicians . There are several extant arrangements , including Piazzolla 's own and one by Pablo Ziegler .

As lynchings in the South reached a peak in 1895 , Washington gave a speech , known as the " Atlanta compromise " , which brought him national fame . He called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship , rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of black voters in the South . Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle - class blacks , church leaders , and white philanthropists and politicians , with a long - term goal of building the community 's economic strength and pride by a focus on self - help and schooling . But , secretly , he also supported court challenges to segregation and restrictions on voter registration , passing on funds to the NAACP for this purpose . Black militants in the North , led by W.   E.   B. Du Bois , at first supported the Atlanta compromise but after 1909 , they set up the NAACP to work for political change . They tried with limited success to challenge Washington 's political machine for leadership in the black community but also built wider networks among white allies in the North . Decades after Washington 's death in 1915 , the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and militant approach , which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South , such as CORE , SNCC and SCLC . Booker T. Washington mastered the nuances of the political arena in the late 19th century , which enabled him to manipulate the media , raise money , develop strategy , network , push , reward friends , and distribute funds , while punishing those who opposed his plans for uplifting blacks . His long - term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of the vast majority of African Americans , who then still lived in the South .

They often form part of broader theories of Jewish conspiracies . According to defense attorney Kenneth Stern , " Historically , Jews have not fared well around conspiracy theories . Such ideas fuel anti - Semitism . The myths that all Jews are responsible for the death of Christ , or poisoned wells , or killed Christian children to bake matzos , or " made up " the Holocaust , or plot to control the world , do not succeed each other ; rather , the list of anti - Semitic canards gets longer . " Some antisemitic canards date back to the birth of Christianity , while some conspiracy theories are more recent . Since at least the Middle Ages , antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory . In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells , had been responsible for the death of Jesus , and ritually consumed the blood of Christians . The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world . Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism , the most notorious example being The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ( 1903 ) . Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler . Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking , Hollywood , the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government . Holocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory because of its position that the Holocaust is a hoax designed to advance the interests of Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel .

In the case of some rivers such as the Columbia , the length listed in the table below is solely that of the main stem . In the case of others such as the Mackenzie , it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries , as noted . Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin , a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg , with main stems of or less . Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi , the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do . Nine rivers in this list cross international boundaries or form them . Four — the Yukon , Columbia , Porcupine , and Kootenay — begin in Canada and flow into the United States . Five — the Milk , Pend d'Oreille , Saint Lawrence , Red , and Saint John — begin in the United States and flow into Canada . Of these , the Milk and the Kootenay cross the international border twice , the Milk leaving and then re - entering the United States , the Kootenay leaving and then re - entering Canada . The drainage basins of these nine rivers extend into both countries ; in addition , the drainage basins of six others — the Fraser , Assiniboine , South Saskatchewan , Saskatchewan , Nelson , and Winnipeg — extend into the United States even though their main stems flow entirely within Canada . Sources report hydrological quantities with varied precision . Biologist and author Ruth Patrick , describing a table of high - discharge rivers , wrote that data on discharge , drainage area , and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted . " It seems , " she said , " that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers , and not to place too much importance on minor ( 10–20 % ) differences in figures .

Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien Régime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed " philosophical works " , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Buscón . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad . The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th - century English - language writers , including Henry Miller , who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time .

The game is reportedly played by adolescents , notably in the United Kingdom , the United States , and Australia . In Australia , it is also known as soggy Sao after the SAO brand of biscuits that are popular there . Although soggy biscuit is not necessarily associated with homosexuality , since the game does not require sexual contact , the idea and practice of the game is in keeping with the spirit of adolescent sexual exploration associated by many in the UK with public schools or in Australia with private schools . Although the terminology may differ slightly , the notability of the game is such that variations on the theme are referred to in popular culture , examples including Stephen Fry 's The Liar , the German film Crazy , the 2006 film Sleeping Dogs Lie , the episode of Blackadder II " Chains " , and the episode of Drawn Together , " Freaks and Greeks " . According to the book Law of the Playground , 1866 men were asked : " How close have you got to the game of soggy biscuit , in which you race to wank onto a cracker ? " Of the respondents , 6.2 % reportedly admitted to having played the game . In November 2011 , The Eagle - Tribune reported that police were investigating claims that two Andover High School ( Massachusetts ) basketball players were hazed by older team members into playing the game . In January 2012 , it was reported that two students were expelled over the incident and a further five were suspended . A grand jury was convened to determine if any of the students should be charged criminally .

The Institute aimed to advance , refine , and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real - world issues . The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor , Milton Friedman , who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis . The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business , Department of Economics , and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields . The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis -- an approach exemplified by Friedman and others . The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics , business , law , and related fields such as public policy and medicine . It hosted workshops , seminars , and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields . The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post - doctoral students , as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students . When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008 , University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create " a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world . ” The university had initially planned to invest $ 200 million in the institute , with half of that in the form of an operating endowment ; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations . The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university , as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman , who was viewed as polarizing . The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university , who argued that to found such an institute would constitute " a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University " and that the proposal reflected " a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics , not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of ' economy and society ' " . In June 2011 , the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics .

It was not an " agreement " and did not set out any new policies , but a memorandum . The memorandum was not classified as a secret but no scholar noticed it in the archives until 1924 . The discussions were between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan ( Count ) Katsura Tarō on 27 July 1905 . The Japanese leader stated Japan 's reasons for its making a protectorate of Korea . He repeated that Japan had no interest in the Philippines . The US had acquired the Philippines following its victory over Spain in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . In 1924 , Tyler Dennett was the first scholar to see the document ; he described it as containing " the text of perhaps the most remarkable ' executive agreement ' in the history of the foreign relations of the United States " . The consensus of historians is that Dennett greatly exaggerated the importance of a routine discussion that changed nothing and set no new policies . Historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new . The word " agreement " in the documents merely means the two sides agreed that the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes both accurately covered the substance of the conversations . President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that War Secretary Taft had correctly stated the American position . When Dennett first discovered the notes he assumed they indicated a highly significant " secret pact " between the US and Japan in creating a basis agreement whereby the two formerly isolationist nations became world powers . The conversations regarded the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States , and maintaining peace between them , in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo - Japanese War . Some Korean historians have assumed that , in the discussions , the United States recognized Japan 's sphere of influence in Korea ; in exchange , Japan recognized the United States ' sphere of influence in the Philippines . However , American historians examining official records report no agreement was ever made — the two men discussed current events but came to no new policy or agreement . They both restated the well - known official policies of their own governments . Indeed , Taft was very careful to indicate these were his private opinions , and he was not an official representative of the U.S. government ( Taft was Secretary of War , not Secretary of State ) .

They often form part of broader theories of Jewish conspiracies . According to defense attorney Kenneth Stern , " Historically , Jews have not fared well around conspiracy theories . Such ideas fuel anti - Semitism . The myths that all Jews are responsible for the death of Christ , or poisoned wells , or killed Christian children to bake matzos , or " made up " the Holocaust , or plot to control the world , do not succeed each other ; rather , the list of anti - Semitic canards gets longer . " Some antisemitic canards date back to the birth of Christianity , while some conspiracy theories are more recent . Since at least the Middle Ages , antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory . In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells , had been responsible for the death of Jesus , and ritually consumed the blood of Christians . The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world . Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism , the most notorious example being The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ( 1903 ) . Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler . Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking , Hollywood , the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government . Holocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory because of its position that the Holocaust is a hoax designed to advance the interests of Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel .

Between 1890 and 1915 , Washington was the dominant leader in the African - American community . Washington was from the last generation of black American leaders born into slavery and became the leading voice of the former slaves and their descendants . They were newly oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow discriminatory laws enacted in the post - Reconstruction Southern states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Washington was a key proponent of African - American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League . His base was the Tuskegee Institute , a historically black college in Alabama . As lynchings in the South reached a peak in 1895 , Washington gave a speech , known as the " Atlanta compromise " , which brought him national fame . He called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship , rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of black voters in the South . Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle - class blacks , church leaders , and white philanthropists and politicians , with a long - term goal of building the community 's economic strength and pride by a focus on self - help and schooling . But , secretly , he also supported court challenges to segregation and restrictions on voter registration , passing on funds to the NAACP for this purpose . Black militants in the North , led by W.   E.   B. Du Bois , at first supported the Atlanta compromise but after 1909 , they set up the NAACP to work for political change . They tried with limited success to challenge Washington 's political machine for leadership in the black community but also built wider networks among white allies in the North . Decades after Washington 's death in 1915 , the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and militant approach , which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South , such as CORE , SNCC and SCLC . Booker T. Washington mastered the nuances of the political arena in the late 19th century , which enabled him to manipulate the media , raise money , develop strategy , network , push , reward friends , and distribute funds , while punishing those who opposed his plans for uplifting blacks . His long - term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of the vast majority of African Americans , who then still lived in the South .

Proponents claim that " certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . " ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses , so it is not science . The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute , a fundamentalist Christian and politically conservative think tank based in the United States . Though the phrase " intelligent design " had featured previously in theological discussions of the design argument , the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People , a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes . The term was substituted into drafts of the book , directly replacing references to creation science and creationism , after the 1987 United States Supreme Court 's Edwards v. Aguillard decision , which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds . From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula . This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science , that it " can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents , " and that the school district 's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity . These arguments assert that certain features ( biological and informational , respectively ) are too complex to be the result of natural processes . As a positive argument against evolution , ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts , a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God . ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features , as defined by ID , are evidence of design . Detailed scientific examination has rebutted the claims that evolutionary explanations are inadequate , and this premise of intelligent design — that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design — is a false dichotomy . It is asserted that ID challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science though proponents concede that they have yet to produce a scientific theory .

The effect relies on simple gimmick and tricks can be performed with it that are self - working , requiring almost no skill . The trick is named after the cocktail Scotch and soda ; the copper coin represents the " Scotch " and the silver coin represents the " soda " . The effect is usually performed as follows : The magician displays two coins of almost equal size , one copper and one silver . The silver coin is most often a U.S. half dollar and the copper coin is usually either an English penny or a Mexican centavo . The magician stacks the coins and places them into the spectator 's hand . He then asks her to place her hands behind her back and put one coin in each hand , remarking that the silver coin is slightly larger than the copper coin , making them easy to tell apart . The magician asks to see the silver coin which the spectator produces . When the spectator opens her other hand , the copper coin has become a quarter . The copper coin can then be made to appear wherever the magician desires , such as in the spectator 's pocket or under an object across the room . Scotch and Soda is a popular trick that can be purchased at magic stores . A number of books exclusively on the subject describe different effects that can be achieved with the Scotch and Soda gimmick . Gin and tonic is a version of the trick using a dime and a penny . Another more recent version is Captain & Coke 2.0 as released by the Blue Crown , it uses a US quarter and a US penny . The modern version that uses a 20 Centavo and a Kennedy half is often attributed to Richard Himber . In the early 1900s , America 's oldest magic company , Martinka made a version that utilized a Barber half dollar and a large cent .

Her first official release after her former band Hole 's break - up , the album 's sound diverged significantly in musical and lyrical content to Hole 's three previous studio albums : Pretty on the Inside ( 1991 ) , Live Through This ( 1994 ) and Celebrity Skin ( 1998 ) . The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles , California , however , was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems , the disbandment of Hole , the controversy surrounding Nirvana 's upcoming box set , and legal problems with various record labels . In spring 2003 , Love traveled to southern France to re - record the album , however , according to Love , she " just wanted to be in a château for six months and do drugs . " The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time . Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing . Upon its release , it received little promotion , with the main source of media exposure being a music video for the album 's first single , " Mono , " and Love 's highly publicised drug issues . America 's Sweetheart received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure , selling little over 200,000 copies in the United States , and with Love further citing the album as " a mistake . " In more recent years , both Love and producer Linda Perry have referred to the album as " le disaster " and " ruined because [ Love ] was coked out , " respectively . The album featured drumming from former Hole drummer Patty Schemel , as well as guest instrumentation and vocals from Emilie Autumn .

mistral_joint_sentence_fact:  50%|█████     | 1/2 [09:13<09:13, 553.37s/it]sentence:  In music , a fugue ( ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices , built on a subject ( a musical theme ) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation ( repetition at different pitches ) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition . It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune , which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American ( i.e. shape note or " Sacred Harp " ) music and West Gallery music . A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition , a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue 's tonic key . Some fugues have a recapitulation . In the Middle Ages , the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance , it had come to denote specifically imitative works . Since the 17th century , the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint . Most fugues open with a short main theme , the subject , which then sounds successively in each voice ( after the first voice is finished stating the subject , a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch , and other voices repeat in the same way ) ; when each voice has entered , the exposition is complete . This is often followed by a connecting passage , or episode , developed from previously heard material ; further " entries " of the subject then are heard in related keys . Episodes ( if applicable ) and entries are usually alternated until the " final entry " of the subject , by which point the music has returned to the opening key , or tonic , which is often followed by closing material , the coda . In this sense , a fugue is a style of composition , rather than a fixed structure . The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions , such as imitative ricercars , capriccios , canzonas , and fantasias . The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685–1750 ) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger ( 1616 – 1667 ) , Johann Pachelbel ( 1653 – 1706 ) , Girolamo Frescobaldi ( 1583 – 1643 ) , Dieterich Buxtehude ( c. 1637–1707 ) and others . With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period , the fugue 's central role waned , eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position . Nevertheless , composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756 – 1791 ) and Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770 – 1827 ) , as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 – 1975 ) .

Design work was discontinued in 2017 when development was shifted to a smaller version , now called BFR . The initial design objective of the ITS launch vehicle was to launch a variety of SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System missions to Mars and other destinations in the beyond - Earth - orbit portion of the Solar System . The first launch was not expected before the 2020s . The ITS launch vehicle was to be operated as a somewhat unusual two - stage rocket . Its first stage was to have been powered by 42 Raptor rocket engines — designed and manufactured by SpaceX — operating on densified ( chilled near triple point ) methane / oxygen , propellants that have not been widely used as rocket propellants in the past . Like the Falcon 9 orbital launch vehicle that preceded it , the ITS launch vehicle 's first stage design was intended to be reusable , following a return to the launch site and vertical landing following each launch . When announced , it was also designed to have a new feature for SpaceX launch vehicles : full reusability of even the second - stage and orbital spacecraft as well . The large payload capacity of the launch vehicle placed it into the super - heavy lift class , with the ability to place into low Earth orbit in reusable configuration and in expendable mode . The second stage of the Earth launch vehicle was planned to have two versions , the Interplanetary spaceship for passengers and cargo and the ITS tanker to deliver propellants to Earth orbit . Both were to be powered by six vacuum - optimized Raptor rocket engines with three additional sea - level - nozzle Raptor engines for maneuvering . Thus , the element of the launch vehicle that was to provide second - stage acceleration to orbital velocity on all launches from Earth would also be used as an on - orbit spacecraft . The Interplanetary spaceship was planned as a very long - duration carrier of both passengers and space cargo to interplanetary destinations , and was to have served as both a descent and ascent vehicle at Mars . The high - level specifications for the vehicle were publicly announced in September 2016 , but by July 2017 , SpaceX had stated they would not build the -diameter vehicles as previously planned , but would instead build a " still large " but much smaller launch vehicle first . Subsequently , that was revealed to be the BFR in September 2017 , a vehicle intended to cost - effectively replace and supersede all existing SpaceX launch vehicles and passenger / cargo spacecraft .
