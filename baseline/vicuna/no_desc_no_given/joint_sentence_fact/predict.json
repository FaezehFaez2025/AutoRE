Bone Machine was included on many Best Albums of the 1990s lists , including Pitchfork where it was number 49 , and Rolling Stone where it was number 53 .", "relations": ["award received", "producer", "performer", "followed by", "record label", "member of", "has part", "publication date", "follows", "part of", "notable work"], "facts": [["Bone Machine", "father", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "performer", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "inception", "1992"], ["Bone Machine", "publication date", "1992"], ["Bone Machine", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Island Records"], ["Bone Machine", "employer", "Island Records"], ["Bone Machine", "author", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "notable work", "album"]], "right_fact_list": [["Bone Machine", "performer", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "publication date", "1992"]], "wrong_fact_list": [["Bone Machine", "father", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "inception", "1992"], ["Bone Machine", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Island Records"], ["Bone Machine", "employer", "Island Records"], ["Bone Machine", "author", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "notable work", "album"]], "miss_fact_list": [[["David Hidalgo", "member of", "Los Lobos"]], [["Keith Richards", "member of", "The Rolling Stones"]], [["Los Lobos", "has part", "David Hidalgo"]], [["The Rolling Stones", "has part", "Keith Richards"]], [["Primus", "has part", "Les Claypool"]], [["Les Claypool", "member of", "Primus"]], [["Bone Machine", "record label", "Island Records"]], [["Bone Machine", "award received", "Grammy Award"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "publication date", "1987"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "performer", "Tom Waits"], ["Franks Wild Years", "performer", "Waits"]], [["Primus", "has part", "Brain"]], [["Tom Waits", "record label", "Island Records"], ["Waits", "record label", "Island Records"]], [["Bone Machine", "producer", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "producer", "Waits"]], [["Brain", "member of", "Primus"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "followed by", "Bone Machine"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "record label", "Island Records"]], [["Bone Machine", "follows", "Franks Wild Years"]], [["Tom Waits", "award received", "Grammy Award"], ["Waits", "award received", "Grammy Award"]], [["David Hidalgo", "part of", "Los Lobos"]], [["Keith Richards", "part of", "The Rolling Stones"]], [["Les Claypool", "part of", "Primus"]], [["Tom Waits", "notable work", "Bone Machine"], ["Waits", "notable work", "Bone Machine"]], [["Tom Waits", "notable work", "Franks Wild Years"], ["Waits", "notable work", "Franks Wild Years"]], [["Brain", "part of", "Primus"]]], "true_fact_list": [[["David Hidalgo", "member of", "Los Lobos"]], [["Keith Richards", "member of", "The Rolling Stones"]], [["Los Lobos", "has part", "David Hidalgo"]], [["The Rolling Stones", "has part", "Keith Richards"]], [["Primus", "has part", "Les Claypool"]], [["Les Claypool", "member of", "Primus"]], [["Bone Machine", "publication date", "1992"]], [["Bone Machine", "record label", "Island Records"]], [["Bone Machine", "award received", "Grammy Award"]], [["Bone Machine", "performer", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "performer", "Waits"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "publication date", "1987"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "performer", "Tom Waits"], ["Franks Wild Years", "performer", "Waits"]], [["Primus", "has part", "Brain"]], [["Tom Waits", "record label", "Island Records"], ["Waits", "record label", "Island Records"]], [["Bone Machine", "producer", "Tom Waits"], ["Bone Machine", "producer", "Waits"]], [["Brain", "member of", "Primus"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "followed by", "Bone Machine"]], [["Franks Wild Years", "record label", "Island Records"]], [["Bone Machine", "follows", "Franks Wild Years"]], [["Tom Waits", "award received", "Grammy Award"], ["Waits", "award received", "Grammy Award"]], [["David Hidalgo", "part of", "Los Lobos"]], [["Keith Richards", "part of", "The Rolling Stones"]], [["Les Claypool", "part of", "Primus"]], [["Tom Waits", "notable work", "Bone Machine"], ["Waits", "notable work", "Bone Machine"]], [["Tom Waits", "notable work", "Franks Wild Years"], ["Waits", "notable work", "Franks Wild Years"]], [["Brain", "part of", "Primus"]]]}

It first appeared in short story form as the cover article for the January 1994 issue of Wired magazine and was subsequently expanded to full novel length . Set in the early 1990s , it captures the state of the technology industry before Windows 95 , and anticipates the dot - com bubble of the late 1990s .

He was probably an officer who did n't have any strong political beliefs and who exhibited courage , dedication and integrity in the defense of the state and its institutions especially in combating the Mafia in Sicily . Nonetheless , the fight against the Mafia carried out by Cesare Mori proved to be effective mainly due to the special powers granted to him by Benito Mussolini when he was prefect in Sicily .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_84", "sentence": "The Horn Blows at Midnight ( 1945 ) is a comedy fantasy film directed by Raoul Walsh , and starring Jack Benny . Its biggest claim to fame , apart from its star , is its failure at the box office . In the two decades following its release , Benny often exploited the film 's failure for laughs in his popular radio and television comedy series The Jack Benny Program , making the film a well - known entity to his wide audience , even if they had never seen it . The Horn Blows At Midnight would prove to be Benny 's final starring feature , although he would continue as a radio and TV star ( as well as making cameo appearances in films ) for years afterwards . The Horn Blows At Midnight had the misfortune to be released only eight days after the death of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt .

The song peaked at number 4 in the US Billboard Hot 100 , number 5 on the Mainstream rock charts , number 35 in the UK and # 44 on the Australian charts . It was the last Top 10 on Billboard chart for the band to date . This song was dedicated to James Kimo Maano , a security guard and best friend of Bret Michaels who had died some time earlier . The cover art for the single depicts a tattoo on Michaels ' arm of a cross with the words \" Something to Believe In \" . The tattoo artist , according to Michaels , had been drinking and spelled \" believe \" incorrectly putting the \" e \" before the \" i \" . It was attempted to be corrected by adding a rose to the cross that covered the misspelling , but Michaels was never satisfied with the results . In the first season of the reality show Rock of Love , Michaels goes to a tattoo shop where the tattoo artist properly touches up the tattoo .", "relations": ["publisher", "present in work",

{"data_from": "redocred_test_80", "sentence": "Berge Meere und Giganten ( Mountains Seas and Giants ) is a 1924 science fiction novel by German author Alfred D\u00f6blin . Stylistically and structurally experimental , the novel follows the development of human society into the 27th century and depicts global - scale conflicts between future polities , technologies , and natural forces , culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland 's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland 's ice cap . Among critics , Berge Meere und Giganten has the reputation of being a difficult and polarizing novel , and has not received nearly as much attention as D\u00f6blin 's following novel , Berlin Alexanderplatz ( 1929 ) .

The program was initiated by 1945 , at which time ca . 5 % of the 2.7 million toll board calls per day were handled by this method . Operator Toll Dialing eliminated the need for intermediate and inward operators to complete toll calls to distant central offices . Initially this system involved step - by - step routings to set up each circuit , but later was improved by the development of area codes with machine translation which helped to standardize dialing across the network . The system was implemented in the USA beginning in 1946 . In 1947 , the North American Numbering Plan for area codes was set up . Operator Toll DIaling was gradually superseded by Direct Distance Dialing ( DDD ) , in which the customer dialed the area code as well as the number . Beginning in 1951 on a limited basis , it was not fully implemented until the 1970s .

The character of much of Barbieri \u2019s work is farcical , utilizing mistaken identity and other devices to entertain the audience . His themes deal largely with the ins and outs of love , and the relations between the upper and lower classes in nineteenth - century Spain , but there is also a distinct political character to much of his work . The zarzuelas El barberillo de Lavapi\u00e9s and Pan y toros both contain plots to overthrow the government . In addition to his compositions , Barbieri was also an accomplished musician .

Gabriel has said that the song is about a relationship in which the woman is sophisticated , bright , cultured , and knows everything about anything and that the man knows nothing about anything , except , he does know about the woman , and she does n't know much about herself . In certain countries , \" Steam \" was more successful than Gabriel 's previous single , \" Digging in the Dirt \" , but in others , it was not . It reached number 10 on the UK Singles Chart , number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100 , and number one on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart . Elsewhere , the song was a number - one hit in Canada , topping the RPM Top Singles chart for the issue dated February 27 , 1993 , knocking Whitney Houston 's massive hit \" I Will Always Love You \" off the top spot after a 10-week run . It was also a top 10 hit in New Zealand and Ireland , peaking at number seven in both countries . An alternative version of this song called \" Quiet Steam \" was a B - side on the \" Digging in the Dirt \" single . It is a very lo - fi take on the popular version that appeared on the album .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_291", "sentence": "\" Ramblin ' on My Mind \" is a blues song recorded on November 23 , 1936 in San Antonio , Texas by blues musician Robert Johnson . The song was originally released on 78 rpm format as Vocalion 03519 and ARC 7 - 05 - 81 . Johnson performed the song in the key of E , and recorded two takes . Both takes were used for different pressings of both the Vocalion issue and the ARC issue . The song used the melody made popular by the hit record \" M & O Blues \" by Walter Davis . Johnson composed two songs to this melody , \" Ramblin ' on My Mind \" and \" When You Got a Good Friend \" , with different musical approaches and different guitar tunings , although both were in the key of E. For \" Ramblin ' on My Mind \" he used an open tuning that allowed him to combine a boogie shuffle on the bass strings with bottleneck triplets on the treble strings . These slide triplets were the model for Elmore James 's guitar accompaniment to \" Dust My Broom \" . The song was recorded by John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton on lead vocals and featured on the album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton ( 1966 ) , and by Clapton on the albums Just One Night , , Sessions for Robert J , and on Live from Madison Square Garden . Lucinda Williams also recorded it for her first professional release , Ramblin ' ( 1979 ) .", "relations": ["composer", "performer", "record label", "lyrics by", "has part", "publication date", "part

In its original airing on the Fox network , the episode had a 12.6 Nielsen rating , finishing the week ranked 38th . \" Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk \" received generally positive reviews from critics and was praised for several scenes , particularly the \" Land of Chocolate \" sequence in which Homer dances around in an imaginary land made entirely out of chocolate .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_345", "sentence": "Bicycles & Tricycles is the sixth studio album from the Orb . It brought together The Orb 's style of the early 1990s with current electronic music to mixed reactions . The Daily Telegraph praised Bicycles & Tricycles as being \" inclusive , exploratory , and an enjoyable journey \" ; however , many other publications dismissed it as \" stoner dub \" and largely irrelevant to current electronic music culture . In addition to Paterson , Roome , Phillips , and Fehlmann , The Corporal contributed with vocoder affected singing and MC Soom - T provided lyrics and rapped . Orb co - founder Jimmy Cauty , too , made a guest appearance as co - writer on Bicycles & Tricycles ' \" From a Distance \" . After departing from Island Records , The Orb released Bicycles & Tricycles in 2004 on Cooking Vinyl in the United Kingdom and Sanctuary Records in the United States . To promote the album , The Orb began a UK tour with dub reggae artist Mad Professor , who had remixed The Orb in the past . Though The Orb still pulled in large crowds , The Guardian described one London performance as \" joyless \" and stated that \" few of the new tracks ... really go anywhere \" . They also noted that Paterson seemed to be far more comfortable and happier to play material from Bicycles & Tricycles rather than older tracks . Paterson 's biggest influences for the album were drum and bass and trip hop music .", "relations": ["country", "performer", "member of", "record label", "located in the administrative territorial

It was retired from commercial service in 1951 due to the extension and improvement of the Klondike Highway in the years after World War II . Following its withdrawal from service the SS Keno was laid up at the BYN Co. shipyard in Whitehorse , before being selected for preservation and donated by the company to the Canadian Government in 1959 . On 25 August 1960 the Keno left Whitehorse to sail downstream to Dawson City . In doing so she became the last of the Yukon 's sternwheeler steamers to navigate the Yukon River under her own power . Three days later she arrived in Dawson and was subsequently installed as a tourist attraction and a permanent memorial to the approximately 250 sternwheelers that provided a vital transport service on

The game is the third instalment of the Jetman series and was later re - released by Nintendo for their NES - based PlayChoice-10 arcade system in the United States in 1990 . In the game , series protagonist Jetman must manoeuvre his small craft through caverns of various planets whilst searching for pieces of the Golden Warpship . The game is presented in a horizontal side - view environment and has ranging gravitational pulls for each planet , which subjects Jetman 's craft to various forms of inertia . Similar to its predecessors , Jetman must keep his craft topped up with fuel in order to progress through levels . The game was developed mostly by Mancunian developer Zippo Games under the name of Iota before being ordered to change the game into a Jetman title by Rare . Ports of the game for the ZX Spectrum , Commodore 64 and Atari ST were completed but not released due to poor sales of the NES version . The game received mostly positive reviews upon release , with critics praising the game 's presentation and graphics , however criticism was directed at the game 's difficulty .

He died at Ascoli Piceno . In a chapel of the Chiesa Nuova , he painted The Archangel Michael driving fallen angels from Heaven . He continued to ornament churches and convents of Rome during the reign of Pope Clement VIII . One of his masterpieces , the Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence , was painted for Santa Caterina in Ancona .

Most of the urban development of Antioch occurred during the Roman Empire , when the city was one of the most important in the eastern Mediterranean area of Rome 's dominions . Antioch was called \" the cradle of Christianity \" as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of both Hellenistic Judaism and early Christianity . The Christian New Testament asserts that the name \" Christian \" first emerged in Antioch . It was one of the four cities of the Syrian tetrapolis , and its residents were known as Antiochenes . The city was a metropolis of half a million people during Augustan times , but it declined to relative insignificance during the Middle Ages because of warfare , repeated earthquakes , and a change in

It was completed in just six days , the time it took Dimitrov 's body to be returned to Sofia from the USSR . Dimitrov 's body remained in the mausoleum until August 1990 , when Dimitrov 's remains were cremated and the ashes buried in the Sofia 's Central Cemetery . The mausoleum itself was destroyed by Prime Minister Ivan Kostov 's UDF government in 1999 after a heated nationwide debate . The prime minister and his party claimed that retaining the mausoleum was inappropriate following the fall of Communism in 1989 because it represented Bulgaria 's repressive past . Even within the government there was opposition to destroying the building , and an opinion poll revealed that two - thirds of the population opposed the demolition . Proposals were made to turn the mausoleum into a museum or art gallery because it contributed to the unique atmosphere of the capital city . In August 1999 , the government made four attempts to demolish the building . The first three failed because they relied on a single powerful explosion . The building did not budge after the first two attempts and tilted only slightly after the third .

Consistent with the supercontinent cycle , Pangaea Ultima could occur within the next 250 million years . This potential configuration , hypothesized by Christopher Scotese , earned its name from its similarity to the previous Pangaea supercontinent . Scotese later renamed Pangaea Ultima ( Last Pangaea ) to Pangaea Proxima ( Next Pangaea ) to alleviate confusion about the name Pangaea Ultima which could imply that it would be the last supercontinent . The concept was based on examination of past cycles of formation and breakup of supercontinents , not on current understanding of the mechanisms of tectonic change , which are too imprecise to project that far into the future . \" It 's all pretty much fantasy to start with , \" Scotese has said . \" But it 's a fun exercise to think about what might happen .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_147", "sentence": "American Theocracy : The Peril and Politics of Radical Religion , Oil , and Borrowed Money in the 21st Century ( ) is a 2005 political commentary book by American political writer Kevin Phillips . The book is a critique of the past forty years of the Republican coalition in United States politics . He \" presents a nightmarish vision of ideological extremism , catastrophic fiscal irresponsibility , rampant greed , and dangerous shortsightedness . \" Phillips points to three unifying themes holding this coalition together . First , its tie to oil and the role oil plays in American and world events . Second , to the coalition of social conservatives , Evangelicals and Pentecostals in this Republican coalition . Finally , he points to the \" debt culture \" of this coalition , and to a coming \" debt bubble \" related to the debt of the U.S. Government and U.S. consumers . He argues that similar issues have been prevalent in the past , when other world powers , such as the Roman Empire and the British Empire declined from their peaks and fell into disarray . While working as a strategist in the presidential campaign of Richard Nixon , Phillips wrote The Emerging Republican Majority . In that book , Phillips predicted the formation of this very coalition that he criticizes in his current book . In American Theocracy he admits that while these \" mutations , \" as he calls them , could have been predicted , he did not foresee the extent to which they would develop and dominate the coalition he helped put together . The last chapter of this book references his first work , and is called \" The Erring Republican Majority . \"", "relations": ["member of political party", "head of government", "country", "country of

{"data_from": "redocred_test_158", "sentence": "Major League Baseball ( MLB ) is the highest level of play in North American professional baseball , and is the organization that operates the National League and the American League . In 2000 , the two leagues were officially disbanded as separate legal entities , and all of their rights and functions were consolidated in the commissioner 's office . Since that time , MLB has operated as a single league , and constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States . It is composed of 30 teams . The First - Year Player Draft , also known as the Rule 4 Draft , is MLB primary mechanism for assigning amateur baseball players from high schools , colleges , and other amateur baseball clubs to its teams . The first draft took place in 1965 ; it was introduced to prevent richer teams from negotiating wealthier contracts with top - level prospects and therefore , monopolizing the player market . Originally , three drafts were held each year . The first draft took place in June and involved high - school graduates and college seniors who had just finished their seasons . The second draft took place in January for high school and college players who had graduated in December . The third draft took place in August and was for players who participated in American amateur summer leagues .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_4", "sentence": "\" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" is a song by American rock band Marilyn Manson and British trip hop band Sneaker Pimps , released as a single from the soundtrack to the 1997 motion picture Spawn . An arena rock and gothic rock song , \" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" was written by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez and produced by Manson and Sean Beavan . Its lyrics are about self - loathing and its title is derived from John Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) . After the track was written , the Sneaker Pimps ' Kelli Ali was recruited to perform background vocals on it , as the Spawn soundtrack featured collaborations between hard rock artists and electronic music artists . The Sneaker Pimps were dissatisfied with the final track and wanted a remix of it to be released as a single instead ; conversely , Manson deemed it a personal favorite . \" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" received mixed reviews from music critics ; some found it heartfelt while others felt it was too indistinct from other Marilyn Manson songs . Commentators noted that the track encapsulated the evolution of the band 's sound from the industrial music of Antichrist Superstar ( 1996 ) to the glam rock of Mechanical Animals ( 1998 ) . Manson initially approached Jonathan Glazer to direct the video for the track , but rejected his concept for it ; Glazer later used his concept for the video for Radiohead 's \" Karma Police \" ( 1997 ) . The music video for \" Long Hard Road Out of Hell \" was directed by Matthew Rolston . It depicts Manson in a dress and a group of models who initially appear to be female but are revealed to be male .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_403", "sentence": "Anna Karenina ( ) is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy , first published in book form in 1878 . Many authors consider Anna Karenina the greatest work of literature ever written , and Tolstoy himself called it his first true novel . It was initially released in serial installments from 1873 to 1877 in the periodical The Russian Messenger . A complex novel in eight parts , with more than a dozen major characters , it is spread over more than 800 pages ( depending on the translation ) , typically contained in two volumes . It deals with themes of betrayal , faith , family , marriage , Imperial Russian society , desire , and rural vs. city life . The plot centers on an extramarital affair between Anna and dashing cavalry officer Count Alexei Kirillovich Vronsky that scandalizes the social circles of Saint Petersburg and forces the young lovers to flee for Italy in a futile search for happiness . Returning to Russia , their lives further unravel . A second major plot line follows Levin , a character loosely based on Tolstoy himself , who rejects glitzy city life and those same social circles for his rural farm , but struggles with both his love for Kitty , who has rejected him , and with his Christian faith . Trains are a recurring motif throughout the novel , which takes place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as a result of the liberal reforms initiated by Emperor Alexander II of Russia , with several major plot points taking place either on passenger trains or at stations in Saint Petersburg or elsewhere in Russia . The novel has been adapted into various media including opera , film , television , ballet , figure skating and radio drama . The first film adaptation was released in 1911 but has not survived .", "relations": ["characters", "languages spoken, written or signed", "present in work", "capital of", "country", "located in the

{"data_from": "redocred_test_40", "sentence": "Ulysses is a modernist novel by Irish writer James Joyce . It was first serialised in parts in the American journal The Little Review from March 1918 to December 1920 and then published in its entirety in Paris by Sylvia Beach on 2 February 1922 , Joyce 's 40th birthday . It is considered to be one of the most important works of modernist literature and has been called \" a demonstration and summation of the entire movement \" . According to Declan Kiberd , \" Before Joyce , no writer of fiction had so foregrounded the process of thinking \" . Ulysses chronicles the peripatetic appointments and encounters of Leopold Bloom in Dublin in the course of an ordinary day , 16 June 1904 . Ulysses is the Latinised name of Odysseus , the hero of Homer 's epic poem the Odyssey , and the novel establishes a series of parallels between the poem and the novel , with structural correspondences between the characters and experiences of Leopold Bloom and Odysseus , Molly Bloom and Penelope , and Stephen Dedalus and Telemachus , in addition to events and themes of the early 20th - century context of modernism , Dublin , and Ireland 's relationship to Britain . The novel is highly allusive and also imitates the styles of different periods of English literature . Since its publication , the book has attracted controversy and scrutiny , ranging from an obscenity trial in the United States in 1921 , to protracted textual \" Joyce Wars \" . The novel 's stream - of - consciousness technique , careful structuring , and experimental prose \u2014 replete with puns , parodies , and allusions \u2014 as well as its rich characterisation and broad humour , have led it to be regarded as one of the greatest literary works in history ; Joyce fans worldwide now celebrate 16 June as Bloomsday .", "relations": ["publisher", "characters",

Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of Communism , the most notorious example being The Protocols of the Elders of Zion ( 1903 ) . Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler . Antisemitic theories persist today in notions concerning banking , Hollywood , the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government .

The effect relies on simple gimmick and tricks can be performed with it that are self - working , requiring almost no skill . The trick is named after the cocktail Scotch and soda ; the copper coin represents the \" Scotch \" and the silver coin represents the \" soda \" . The effect is usually performed as follows : The magician displays two coins of almost equal size , one copper and one silver . The silver coin is most often a U.S. half dollar and the copper coin is usually either an English penny or a Mexican centavo . The magician stacks the coins and places them into the spectator 's hand . He then asks her to place her hands behind her back and put one coin in each hand , remarking that the silver coin is slightly larger than the copper coin , making them easy to tell apart . The magician asks to see the silver coin which the spectator produces . When the spectator opens her other hand , the copper coin has become a quarter . The copper coin can then be made to appear wherever the magician desires , such as in the spectator 's pocket or under an object across the room . Scotch and Soda is a popular trick that can be purchased at magic stores . A number of books exclusively on the subject describe different effects that can be achieved with the Scotch and Soda gimmick . Gin and tonic is a version of the trick using a dime and a penny . Another more recent version is Captain & Coke 2.0 as released by the Blue Crown , it uses a US quarter and a US penny .

The recording process of the album began in summer 2001 in Los Angeles , California , however , was affected drastically by a number of personal and legal issues by Love ; including her drug problems , the disbandment of Hole , the controversy surrounding Nirvana 's upcoming box set , and legal problems with various record labels . In spring 2003 , Love traveled to southern France to re - record the album , however , according to Love , she \" just wanted to be in a ch\u00e2teau for six months and do drugs . \" The album had three main producers , one of whom , James Barber , was Love 's partner at the time . Following recording , America 's Sweetheart was further delayed due to Virgin 's excessive input on the album 's mastering , art work and design , and track listing .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_30", "sentence": "\" Amambanda \" was the Dutch entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 , performed predominantly in an imaginary language but with some words in English by Treble . This was the second occasion on which a song had been performed with lyrics in an invented language - Belgium having entered Sanomi by Urban Trad at the 2003 Contest . The song is an up - tempo number , with many influences from African and flamenco music . The lyrics explain that \" There is a way / To understand without a language \" , in keeping with the musical theme of exuberant joy in spite of an apparently insurmountable language barrier . The title was the cause of much confusion prior to the Contest , with the official CD of entries titling the track \" Amanbanda \" ( with an \" n \" instead of an \" m \" ) . BBC commentary referred to the song as \" Amamdangda \" briefly , as well as describing the group as \" a mother and her two daughters \" , which was also incorrect as Caroline Hoffman was not the mother of the two van Dijk sisters , though this comment was sarcastic and not taken as literal by listeners . As the Netherlands had not finished the 2005 Contest in the top 10 , the song was performed in the semi - final . Here , it was performed seventeenth , following Finland 's Lordi with \" Hard Rock Hallelujah \" and preceding Lithuania 's LT United with \" We Are The Winners \" . At the close of voting , it had received 22 points , placing 20th in a field of 23 and thus missing out on the final and requiring the Netherlands to qualify from the semi - final at the next Contest . Immediately following this result , rumours began to circulate that the Netherlands would opt out of the next Contest . These rumours were , however , proven to be untrue as the country began qualification for the 2007 Contest . It was succeeded as Dutch representative at the 2007 Contest by Edsilia Rombley with \" On Top of the World \" .", "relations": ["follows", "participant in", "performer", "followed by", "country of

His imprisonment drew protest from the US State Department and Amnesty International , the latter of which named him a prisoner of conscience . Mich\u00e1 was active with the Progress Party of Equatorial Guinea ( PPGE ) , a banned political party opposing the long - dominant Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea . In late March 2008 , he was arrested without a warrant . Within a week , fellow PPGE activists Cruz Obiang Ebele , Gumersindo Ram\u00edrez Faustino , Juan Ecomo Ndong , Gerardo Ang\u00fce Mangue , and Bonifacio Nguema Ndong were also arrested . Mich\u00e1 was held for two months at the police station , turning which time he was allegedly tortured . In May 2008 , the six men were charged with knowledge of a weapons cache in the home of another PPGE activist , Saturnino Ncogo . Ncogo had died in prison on early March in suspicious circumstances . Authorities alleged he had thrown himself from the top bunk of his cell to commit suicide , but relatives received his body in an advanced state of decomposition , and no investigation was ever conducted . According to Amnesty International , the six men were given an unfair trial at which no evidence was presented save the weapons from Ncogo 's home and the statements the six had made under duress ; in addition , the six defendants alleged that police had altered their statements after the defendants had signed them . Despite being charged with unrelated crimes , the six were tried alongside Simon Mann , a UK national who had helped to organize a 2004 coup attempt . The six PPGE members were given sentences of one to five years apiece . The US State Department considers Mich\u00e1 a political prisoner , and has objected to his continued imprisonment . Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience , and has called for his immediate release .", "relations": ["member of political party", "country", "member of", "country of citizenship",

{"data_from": "redocred_test_362", "sentence": "The genocide of indigenous peoples is the mass destruction of entire communities of indigenous peoples . Indigenous peoples are understood to be people whose historical and current territory has become occupied by colonial expansion , or the formation of a state by a dominant group such as a colonial power . While the concept of genocide was formulated by Raphael Lemkin in the mid-20th century , the earlier expansion of various European colonial powers such as the Spanish and British empires , and the subsequent establishment of colonies on indigenous territory , frequently involved acts of genocidal violence against indigenous groups in the Americas , Australia , Africa and Asia . According to Lemkin , colonization was in itself \" intrinsically genocidal \" . He saw this genocide as a two - stage process , the first being the destruction of the indigenous population 's way of life . In the second stage , the newcomers impose their way of life on the indigenous group . According to David Maybury - Lewis , imperial and colonial forms of genocide are enacted in two main ways , either through the deliberate clearing of territories of their original inhabitants in order to make them exploitable for purposes of resource extraction or colonial settlements , or through enlisting indigenous peoples as forced laborers in colonial or imperialist projects of resource extraction . The designation of specific events as genocidal is often controversial . Some scholars , among them Lemkin , have argued that cultural genocide , sometimes called ethnocide , should also be recognized . A people may continue to exist , but if they are prevented from perpetuating their group identity by prohibitions against cultural and religious practices that are the basis of that identity , this may also be considered a form of genocide . Examples include the treatment of Tibetans by the Chinese government and Native Americans by the US government .", "relations": ["country", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "subclass of", "continent", "has part", "part of"], "facts": [["indigenous peoples", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "colonial expansion"], ["indigenous peoples", "country", "colonial power"]], "right_fact_list": [], "wrong_fact_list": [["indigenous peoples", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "colonial expansion"], ["indigenous peoples", "country", "colonial power"]], "miss_fact_list": [[["Native Americans", "country", "US"]], [["Native Americans", "subclass of", "Indigenous peoples"]], [["Chinese", "continent", "Asia"]], [["Chinese", "part of", "Asia"]], [["Asia", "has part", "Chinese"]], [["Native Americans", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "US"]]], "true_fact_list": [[["Native Americans", "country", "US"]], [["Native Americans", "subclass of", "Indigenous peoples"]], [["Chinese", "continent", "Asia"]], [["Chinese", "part of", "Asia"]], [["Asia", "has part", "Chinese"]], [["Native Americans", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "US"]]]}
{"data_from": "redocred_test_377", "sentence": "The Battle of Sio , fought between December 1943 and March 1944 , was the break - out and pursuit phase of General Douglas MacArthur 's Huon Peninsula campaign , part of the New Guinea campaign of World War II . After the defeat of the Japanese in the Battle of Sattelberg , Australian Army forces broke through the Japanese positions around Finschhafen . Constant pressure from US Navy PT boats , Australian land forces and Allied aircraft brought the Japanese logistical system to the brink of collapse , resulting in disease , malnutrition , and privation for the Japanese soldiers . Meanwhile , the Allied supply system grappled with the problems of terrain and climate , particularly inclement weather and rough monsoonal seas that hampered and occasionally prevented delivery of supplies by sea . Australian and Papuan troops advanced along the coast of the Huon Peninsula , using infantry , tanks , and air strikes against the Japanese positions , which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle . The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery , which was liberally employed in the early stages of the operation . Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour , the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced , ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor . Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed ; thousands more died from disease , malnutrition , exhaustion and suicide . The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces . During the advance , Australian troops captured Japanese cryptographic materials . This had an important effect on the subsequent course of the war against Japan in the South West Pacific , as it permitted codebreakers in Australia and the United States to read Japanese Army messages on a much greater scale than previously .", "relations": ["ethnic group", "country", "point in time", "participant in", "conflict", "located in the administrative territorial entity",

{"data_from": "redocred_test_93", "sentence": "Il Gobbo di Rialto or the Hunchback of the Rialto is a granite statue of a hunchback found opposite the Church of San Giacomo di Rialto at the end of the Rialto in Venice . Sculpted by Pietro da Sal\u00f2 in the 16th century , the statue takes the form of a crouching , naked hunchback supporting a small flight of steps . According to the writings of Stefano Magno it was unveiled on 16 November 1541 and was used as a podium for official proclamations : the statutes of Venice or the names of offenders would be proclaimed by an official standing on the block at the same time as they were read out at Pietra del Bando near Piazza San Marco . It was also used as the finishing point for a punishment for minor misdemeanours ; the guilty party would be stripped naked and made to run the gauntlet of citizens lining the streets from Piazza San Marco to the Rialto , saving themselves further humiliation by kissing the statue . By the 19th century , time had taken its toll on the statue and , in 1836 , it was restored with funds provided by the civic authorities . The block above the hunchback 's head now bears a Latin inscription with the date of the restoration . It is said to communicate with the Pasquino , one of the talking statues of Rome . From the early 16th century the Pasquino , a statue of a torso , was used as an agent for critical commentaries against the Pope and the authorities : satirical notes would be attached anonymously to the base of the statue purporting to come from the Pasquino himself . Other statues in Rome would be used to fulfill a similar purpose and establish a dialogue . In the 17th century the Pasquino exchanged correspondence with Il Gobbo concerning the Republic of Venice , Pope Paul V and the writings of Cardinals Baronio and Bellarmino . The characters of Launcelot Gobbo and his father , Old Gobbo , in William Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice may have been inspired by this traditional symbol of the Rialto .", "relations":

{"data_from": "redocred_test_173", "sentence": "The Orange Grove affair was a political scandal in Australia concerning the dealings of the New South Wales state Australian Labor Party government with multinational corporation The Westfield Group . It resulted from a court decision in 2004 to force the closure of the Orange Grove shopping centre after a zoning dispute , with the loss of approximately 200 jobs . Westfield , who owned a nearby shopping centre , had challenged the legitimacy of the Orange Grove centre , which was operating on land not zoned for this purpose . When the courts ruled in Westfield 's favor , Liverpool City Council sought State Government approval for a retrospective rezoning , to validate its earlier decision to approve the shopping centre . The State Government declined to intervene , despite a planning report suggesting that course of action , and the retail component of the Orange Grove centre was forced to close . The bulky goods component of the centre remained open , as the centre was legally zoned for bulky goods sales . However , the state Opposition subsequently unearthed information about a meeting between Premier Bob Carr 's chief of staff and a prominent Westfield employee , sparking allegations that interference from Westfield had played a role in the government 's decision not to intervene . As a result , a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned , and the Independent Commission Against Corruption announced an investigation . The investigation concluded in 2005 , with no findings of corruption against any person . However , the Commission recommended that the NSW Government strengthen guidelines for public servants dealing with corruption allegations by lobbyists . Unlike Nick Greiner in 1992 and Barry O'Farrell in 2014 , the Orange Grove affair marked the only time that a sitting Premier in Bob \u00a0 Carr had survived appearing before ICAC although Carr did retire mere months after the conclusion of ICAC 's investigation of the Orange Grove affair .", "relations": ["instance of", "head of government", "country", "member of", "located in the

The resolutions were a long series of demands for political reforms in the British - governed colony . Papineau had been elected speaker of the legislative assembly of Lower Canada in 1815 . His party constantly opposed the unelected colonial government , and in 1828 he helped draft an early form of the resolutions , essentially a list of grievances against the colonial administration . To ensure that the views of the Legislative Assembly be understood by the British House of Commons , the Parti patriote had sent its own delegation to London in order to submit a memoir and a petition signed by 87,000 people . On February 28 , 1834 , Papineau presented the Ninety - Two Resolutions to the Legislative Assembly which were approved and sent to London . The resolutions included , among other things , demands for an elected Legislative Council and an Executive Council responsible before the house of representatives . Under the Constitutional Act of 1791 , the government of Lower Canada was given an elected legislative assembly , but members of the upper houses were appointed by the Governor of the colony . In the resolutions , the elected representatives once again reiterated their loyalty to the British Crown , but expressed frustration that the government of London had been unwilling to correct the injustices caused by the past governments of the colony . Papineau 's resolutions were ignored for almost three years ; meanwhile , the Legislative Assembly did all it could to oppose the un - elected upper houses while avoiding outright rebellion . British Colonial Secretary Lord Russell eventually responded to them by issuing ten resolutions of his own ( the Russell Resolutions ) . All of the Legislative Assembly 's demands were rejected . The ten resolutions reached Canada in 1837 , and many of Papineau 's reformists began to agitate for a rebellion .

Similar to spiritual leaders , the imam khatib is the one who leads Islamic worship services . More often , the community turns to the mosque imam if they have a religious question . In smaller communities , an imam could also be the community leader . The term is not to be confused with the use of Imams of Shi'a Islam , where it has a meaning more central to belief , referring to main leaders of the Shi'a community . The term imam is also used for a recognized religious scholar or authority in Islam , often for the founding scholars of the four Sunni madhhabs , or schools of jurisprudence ( fiqh ) . It may also refer to the Muslim scholars who created the analytical sciences related to Hadith or it may refer to the heads of the Prophet Muhammad 's family in their generational times .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_216", "sentence": "Ferrous metallurgy is the metallurgy of iron and its alloys . It began far back in prehistory . The earliest surviving iron artifacts , from the 4th millennium BC in Egypt , were made from meteoritic iron - nickel . It is not known when or where the smelting of iron from ores began , but by the end of the 2nd millennium BC iron was being produced from iron ores from Sub - Saharan Africa to China . The use of wrought iron ( worked iron ) was known by the 1st millennium BC , and its spread marked the Iron Age . During the medieval period , means were found in Europe of producing wrought iron from cast iron ( in this context known as pig iron ) using finery forges . For all these processes , charcoal was required as fuel . Steel ( with a carbon content between pig iron and wrought iron ) was first produced in antiquity as an alloy . Its process of production , Wootz steel , was exported before the 4th century BC from India to ancient China , Africa , the Middle East and Europe . Archaeological evidence of cast iron appears in 5th - century BC China . New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century . During the Industrial Revolution , new methods of producing bar iron by substituting coke for charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel , creating a new era of greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age . In the late 1850s , Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process , that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon , and so to produce mild steel . This and other 19th - century and later steel making processes have displaced wrought iron . Today , wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale , having been displaced by the functionally equivalent mild or low carbon steel . The largest and most modern underground iron ore mine in the world is located in Kiruna , Norrbotten County , Lapland . The mine which is owned by Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB , a large Swedish mining company , has an annual production capacity of over 26 million tonnes of iron ore .", "relations": ["country", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "continent", "contains administrative territorial entity", "has part", "part of"], "facts": [], "right_fact_list": [], "wrong_fact_list": [], "miss_fact_list": [[["Kiruna", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Lapland", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Sub - Saharan Africa", "part of", "Africa"]], [["Sub - Saharan Africa", "continent", "Africa"]], [["Kiruna", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Norrbotten County", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Lapland"]], [["Norrbotten County", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Norrbotten County", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Kiruna"]], [["Lapland", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Swedish", "has part", "Lapland"]], [["Lapland", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Swedish", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Africa", "has part", "Sub - Saharan Africa"]], [["Lapland", "part of", "Swedish"]], [["Kiruna", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Norrbotten County", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Lapland", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Kiruna", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Lapland"]]], "true_fact_list": [[["Kiruna", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Lapland", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Sub - Saharan Africa", "part of", "Africa"]], [["Sub - Saharan Africa", "continent", "Africa"]], [["Kiruna", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Norrbotten County", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Lapland"]], [["Norrbotten County", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Norrbotten County", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Kiruna"]], [["Lapland", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Swedish", "has part", "Lapland"]], [["Lapland", "country", "Swedish"]], [["Swedish", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Norrbotten County"]], [["Africa", "has part", "Sub - Saharan Africa"]], [["Lapland", "part of", "Swedish"]], [["Kiruna", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Norrbotten County", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara AB", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Lapland", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Swedish"]], [["Kiruna", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Lapland"]]]}

The document specifically states that it is aimed at bishops , priests , religious and other pastoral workers in hopes of pastoral caregivers paying greater attention to expressions of human mobility . The document derived some of its material from the Old Testament , the New Testament , the American Automobile Association , and statements by Popes Pius XII , John XXIII , Paul VI and John Paul II . On its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of Ten Commandments for Drivers . In essence , the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component . The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences . The problem is not as pervasive in the Vatican City itself , which has a speed limit of 30 \u00a0 km / h ( 18 - 19 \u00a0 mph ) and approximately only 1000 cars ; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century , and the Vatican is responding . In the same section of the document as the Drivers ' Ten Commandments are the so - called Christian virtues of drivers , which include prudence , justice and hope . The Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road , but also address prostitution , caring for street children and the homeless , found in Parts Two , Three and Four of the Guidelines . The Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers , which leads to road rage , rude gestures , speeding , drinking behind the wheel , cursing , blasphemy , impoliteness , and intentional violation of the highway code . The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code , pray behind the wheel and recite the rosary , which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver 's attention .", "relations":

{"data_from": "redocred_test_349", "sentence": "Henry Wager Halleck ( January 16 , 1815 \u2013 January 9 , 1872 ) was a United States Army officer , scholar , and lawyer . A noted expert in military studies , he was known by a nickname that became derogatory : \" Old Brains . \" He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer . Halleck served as General - in - Chief of all Union armies during the American Civil War . Early in the Civil War , Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater . He commanded operations in the Western Theater from 1861 until 1862 , during which time , while the Union armies in the east were defeated and held back , the troops under Halleck 's command won many important victories . However , Halleck was not present at the battles , and his subordinates earned most of the recognition . The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the Siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862 , a Union victory which he conducted with extreme caution . Halleck also developed rivalries with many of his subordinate generals , such as Ulysses S. Grant and Don Carlos Buell . In July 1862 , following Major General George B. McClellan 's failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater , Halleck was promoted to general - in - chief of all U.S. armies . Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half . Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick , aggressive action . He was a master of administration , logistics , and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy , but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington , D.C. His subordinates frequently criticized him and at times ignored his instructions . President Abraham Lincoln once described him as \" little more than a first rate clerk . \" In March 1864 , Grant was promoted to general - in - chief , and Halleck was relegated to chief - of - staff .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_55", "sentence": "Consort Mei ( died 755 ) was an imperial consort of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang . She was one of Emperor Xuanzong 's favorite concubine , often known as Mei fei ( with fei being a standard rank for imperial consorts during her lifetime ) . Her actual name was Jiang Caipin ( \u6c5f\u91c7\u860b ) , originally called Consort Jiang . After being told by her that she greatly favored Plum - Blossom flowers ( the flower is pronounced as mei in Chinese ) , Emperor Xuanzong began to fondly address her as Consort Mei . Consort Mei was initially selected by Gao Lishi , an eunuch official of Emperor Xuanzong , to become one of Emperor Xuanzong 's concubines in his harem . As Consort Mei was the most literate and talented concubines , she soon obtained Xuanzong 's favors . To express the favors towards Consort Mei , Xuanzong commanded servants to plant Plum - Blossom trees all around her palace to please her interest . Xuanzong even lovingly complimented her beauty as more adorable than Zhao Feiyan , and swore that he would never change his heart for her . However , in 737 , after the death of Consort Wu , another favorite concubine of Xuanzong , Xuanzong was deeply depressed until Gao Lishi convinced him to try looking at Yang Yuhuan - the wife of prince Li Mao , Xuanzong son with Consort Wu since her beauty was described as the most \" irresistible \" . Being curious , Xuanzong ordered Yang Yuhuan to come and subsequently fell in love with her beauty . Since Yuhuan was still literally his daughter - in - law ( as she was Li Mao 's wife ) , emperor Xuanzong then stealthily arranged Yuhuan to become a Taoist nun , after a brief moment , Xuanzong eventually offered Yuhuan honorable title as Yang Guifei ( with Guifei being the highest rank for imperial consorts ) after bestowing his son Li Mao a new wife . Yuhuan became Xuanzong 's most beloved consort as Xuanzong soon forgot about Consort Wu 's death . His favors towards Consort Mei also waned .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_372", "sentence": "Mar\u00eda de Buenos Aires is a tango operetta ( tango operita ) with music by \u00c1stor Piazzolla and libretto by Horacio Ferrer that premiered at the Sala Planeta in Buenos Aires on 8 May 1968 . The first part of the surreal plot centers on the experiences of a prostitute in Buenos Aires , Argentina ; the second part takes place after her death . The characters include Mar\u00eda ( and , after her death , the Shadow of Mar\u00eda ) , a singer of payadas ; various members of the Buenos Aires underworld ; a payador who functions as a poet and narrator ; a goblin - like duende ; several marionettes under the control of the duende ; a circus of psychoanalysts ; pasta makers ; and construction workers . Many elements of the libretto suggest parallels between Mar\u00eda and Mary , the mother of Jesus ( in Spanish , Mar\u00eda ) or Jesus himself . While certainly not in the narrow sense an opera ballet , because the dance is tango rather than classical ballet , it falls within the tradition of having set dance pieces integral to an operatic work . The music draws on the nuevo tango idiom for which Piazzolla is famous . The original idea for the story was conceived by Piazzolla 's lover at the time of its composition , Egle Martin , who was married to Eduardo \" Lalo \" Palacios . The title role was originally conceived for Martin , but while Piazzolla was still composing the operita , he and Martin broke up after he asked her husband for her hand at Christmas in 1967 . According to Martin , Piazzolla said to Lalo , \" She is music , she ca n't belong to anybody , no she is music , she is music , and that 's me . \" After their rift , a replacement was desperately needed , but Piazzolla soon met folksinger Amelita Baltar at the Buenos Aires nightclub Nuestro Tiempo , formerly known as \" 676 \" and once Piazzolla 's home base in Argentina . Baltar 's identification with the character Mar\u00eda , paired with her beauty and captivating stage presence , made her ideal for the role . The piece is written for at least three vocalists ( one of whom , the narrator , mainly speaks rather sings ) . For the orchestration Piazzolla augmented his current working quintet : Piazzolla ( bandone\u00f3n ) , Antonio Agri ( violin ) , Jamie \" El Russo \" Gosis ( piano ) , Oscar Lopez Ruiz ( guitar ) and Kicho D\u00edaz ( double bass ) ; with viola , cello , flute , percussion , vibraphone and xylophone , and a second guitar . Mar\u00eda de Buenos Aires has often been performed with dancers as well as musicians .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_60", "sentence": "Booker Taliaferro Washington ( \u2013 November 14 , 1915 ) was an American educator , author , orator , and advisor to presidents of the United States . Between 1890 and 1915 , Washington was the dominant leader in the African - American community . Washington was from the last generation of black American leaders born into slavery and became the leading voice of the former slaves and their descendants . They were newly oppressed in the South by disenfranchisement and the Jim Crow discriminatory laws enacted in the post - Reconstruction Southern states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Washington was a key proponent of African - American businesses and one of the founders of the National Negro Business League . His base was the Tuskegee Institute , a historically black college in Alabama . As lynchings in the South reached a peak in 1895 , Washington gave a speech , known as the \" Atlanta compromise \" , which brought him national fame . He called for black progress through education and entrepreneurship , rather than trying to challenge directly the Jim Crow segregation and the disenfranchisement of black voters in the South . Washington mobilized a nationwide coalition of middle - class blacks , church leaders , and white philanthropists and politicians , with a long - term goal of building the community 's economic strength and pride by a focus on self - help and schooling . But , secretly , he also supported court challenges to segregation and restrictions on voter registration , passing on funds to the NAACP for this purpose . Black militants in the North , led by W. \u00a0 E. \u00a0 B. Du Bois , at first supported the Atlanta compromise but after 1909 , they set up the NAACP to work for political change . They tried with limited success to challenge Washington 's political machine for leadership in the black community but also built wider networks among white allies in the North . Decades after Washington 's death in 1915 , the civil rights movement of the 1950s took a more active and militant approach , which was also based on new grassroots organizations based in the South , such as CORE , SNCC and SCLC . Booker T. Washington mastered the nuances of the political arena in the late 19th century , which enabled him to manipulate the media , raise money , develop strategy , network , push , reward friends , and distribute funds , while punishing those who opposed his plans for uplifting blacks . His long - term goal was to end the disenfranchisement of the vast majority of African Americans , who then still lived in the South .", "relations": ["ethnic group", "country", "point in time", "member of", "country of citizenship", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "applies to jurisdiction", "founded by", "contains administrative territorial entity", "has part", "date of death", "part of", "inception"], "facts": [["Booker Taliaferro Washington", "educated at", "Tuskegee Institute"], ["Booker Taliaferro Washington", "head of government", "United States"]], "right_fact_list": [], "wrong_fact_list": [["Booker Taliaferro Washington", "educated at", "Tuskegee Institute"], ["Booker Taliaferro Washington", "head of government", "United States"]], "miss_fact_list": [[["NAACP", "inception", "1909"]], [["Washington", "date of death", "1915"], ["Booker T.

{"data_from": "redocred_test_43", "sentence": "The ITS launch vehicle was a 2016 - 2017 design for a privately funded orbital launch vehicle planned to be developed by SpaceX. Design work was discontinued in 2017 when development was shifted to a smaller version , now called BFR . The initial design objective of the ITS launch vehicle was to launch a variety of SpaceX Interplanetary Transport System missions to Mars and other destinations in the beyond - Earth - orbit portion of the Solar System . The first launch was not expected before the 2020s . The ITS launch vehicle was to be operated as a somewhat unusual two - stage rocket . Its first stage was to have been powered by 42 Raptor rocket engines \u2014 designed and manufactured by SpaceX \u2014 operating on densified ( chilled near triple point ) methane / oxygen , propellants that have not been widely used as rocket propellants in the past . Like the Falcon 9 orbital launch vehicle that preceded it , the ITS launch vehicle 's first stage design was intended to be reusable , following a return to the launch site and vertical landing following each launch . When announced , it was also designed to have a new feature for SpaceX launch vehicles : full reusability of even the second - stage and orbital spacecraft as well . The large payload capacity of the launch vehicle placed it into the super - heavy lift class , with the ability to place into low Earth orbit in reusable configuration and in expendable mode . The second stage of the Earth launch vehicle was planned to have two versions , the Interplanetary spaceship for passengers and cargo and the ITS tanker to deliver propellants to Earth orbit . Both were to be powered by six vacuum - optimized Raptor rocket engines with three additional sea - level - nozzle Raptor engines for maneuvering . Thus , the element of the launch vehicle that was to provide second - stage acceleration to orbital velocity on all launches from Earth would also be used as an on - orbit spacecraft .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_226", "sentence": "Between 2008 and 2011 , the Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics was an academic center established at the University of Chicago as a collaborative , cross - disciplinary site for research in economics . The Institute aimed to advance , refine , and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real - world issues . The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor , Milton Friedman , who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis . The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business , Department of Economics , and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields . The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis -- an approach exemplified by Friedman and others . The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics , business , law , and related fields such as public policy and medicine . It hosted workshops , seminars , and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields . The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post - doctoral students , as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students . When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008 , University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create \" a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world . \u201d The university had initially planned to invest $ 200 million in the institute , with half of that in the form of an operating endowment ; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations . The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university , as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman , who was viewed as polarizing . The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university , who argued that to found such an institute would constitute \" a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University \" and that the proposal reflected \" a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics , not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of ' economy and society ' \" . In June 2011 , the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics .", "relations": ["instance of", "parent organization", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "subclass of", "chairperson", "has part", "part of", "subsidiary", "work location", "inception", "employer"], "facts": [["academic center", "applies to jurisdiction", "University of Chicago"], ["Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics", "has part", "University of Chicago"], ["University of Chicago", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Chicago"], ["economics", "applies to jurisdiction", "academic center"], ["Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "University of Chicago"]], "right_fact_list": [["University of Chicago", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Chicago"]], "wrong_fact_list": [["academic center", "applies to jurisdiction", "University of Chicago"], ["Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics", "has part", "University of Chicago"], ["economics", "applies to jurisdiction", "academic center"], ["Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "University of Chicago"]], "miss_fact_list": [[["University", "instance of", "Institute"], ["University", "instance of", "Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics"], ["University of Chicago", "instance of", "Institute"], ["University of Chicago", "instance of", "Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics"]], [["University", "chairperson", "Robert J.

{"data_from": "redocred_test_300", "sentence": "In music , a fugue ( ) is a contrapuntal compositional technique in two or more voices , built on a subject ( a musical theme ) that is introduced at the beginning in imitation ( repetition at different pitches ) and which recurs frequently in the course of the composition . It is not to be confused with a fuguing tune , which is a style of song popularized by and mostly limited to early American ( i.e. shape note or \" Sacred Harp \" ) music and West Gallery music . A fugue usually has three main sections : an exposition , a development and a final entry that contains the return of the subject in the fugue 's tonic key . Some fugues have a recapitulation . In the Middle Ages , the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style ; by the Renaissance , it had come to denote specifically imitative works . Since the 17th century , the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint . Most fugues open with a short main theme , the subject , which then sounds successively in each voice ( after the first voice is finished stating the subject , a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch , and other voices repeat in the same way ) ; when each voice has entered , the exposition is complete . This is often followed by a connecting passage , or episode , developed from previously heard material ; further \" entries \" of the subject then are heard in related keys . Episodes ( if applicable ) and entries are usually alternated until the \" final entry \" of the subject , by which point the music has returned to the opening key , or tonic , which is often followed by closing material , the coda . In this sense , a fugue is a style of composition , rather than a fixed structure . The form evolved during the 18th century from several earlier types of contrapuntal compositions , such as imitative ricercars , capriccios , canzonas , and fantasias . The famous fugue composer Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685\u20131750 ) shaped his own works after those of Johann Jakob Froberger ( 1616 \u2013 1667 ) , Johann Pachelbel ( 1653 \u2013 1706 ) , Girolamo Frescobaldi ( 1583 \u2013 1643 ) , Dieterich Buxtehude ( c. 1637\u20131707 ) and others . With the decline of sophisticated styles at the end of the baroque period , the fugue 's central role waned , eventually giving way as sonata form and the symphony orchestra rose to a dominant position . Nevertheless , composers continued to write and study fugues for various purposes ; they appear in the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ( 1756 \u2013 1791 ) and Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770 \u2013 1827 ) , as well as modern composers such as Dmitri Shostakovich ( 1906 \u2013 1975 ) .", "relations": ["influenced by", "date of death", "date of birth"], "facts": [], "right_fact_list": [], "wrong_fact_list": [], "miss_fact_list": [[["Johann Sebastian Bach", "influenced by", "Johann Pachelbel"]], [["Johann Sebastian Bach", "date of birth", "1685\u20131750"]], [["Johann Jakob Froberger", "influenced by", "Johann Sebastian Bach"]], [["Johann Jakob Froberger", "date of birth", "1616"]], [["Johann Jakob Froberger", "date of death", "1667"]], [["Johann Pachelbel", "date of birth", "1653"]], [["Johann Pachelbel", "date of death", "1706"]], [["Girolamo Frescobaldi", "date of birth", "1583"]], [["Girolamo Frescobaldi", "date of death", "1643"]], [["Dieterich Buxtehude", "date of birth", "c. 1637\u20131707"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "influenced by", "Johann Sebastian Bach"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "influenced by", "Ludwig van Beethoven"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "date of birth", "1756"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "date of death", "1791"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "influenced by", "Johann Sebastian Bach"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "influenced by", "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "influenced by", "Dmitri Shostakovich"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "date of birth", "1770"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "date of death", "1827"]], [["Dmitri Shostakovich", "influenced by", "Ludwig van Beethoven"]], [["Dmitri Shostakovich", "date of birth", "1906"]], [["Dmitri Shostakovich", "date of death", "1975"]]], "true_fact_list": [[["Johann Sebastian Bach", "influenced by", "Johann Pachelbel"]], [["Johann Sebastian Bach", "date of birth", "1685\u20131750"]], [["Johann Jakob Froberger", "influenced by", "Johann Sebastian Bach"]], [["Johann Jakob Froberger", "date of birth", "1616"]], [["Johann Jakob Froberger", "date of death", "1667"]], [["Johann Pachelbel", "date of birth", "1653"]], [["Johann Pachelbel", "date of death", "1706"]], [["Girolamo Frescobaldi", "date of birth", "1583"]], [["Girolamo Frescobaldi", "date of death", "1643"]], [["Dieterich Buxtehude", "date of birth", "c. 1637\u20131707"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "influenced by", "Johann Sebastian Bach"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "influenced by", "Ludwig van Beethoven"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "date of birth", "1756"]], [["Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart", "date of death", "1791"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "influenced by", "Johann Sebastian Bach"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "influenced by", "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "influenced by", "Dmitri Shostakovich"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "date of birth", "1770"]], [["Ludwig van Beethoven", "date of death", "1827"]], [["Dmitri Shostakovich", "influenced by", "Ludwig van Beethoven"]], [["Dmitri Shostakovich", "date of birth", "1906"]], [["Dmitri Shostakovich", "date of death", "1975"]]]}

It was not an \" agreement \" and did not set out any new policies , but a memorandum . The memorandum was not classified as a secret but no scholar noticed it in the archives until 1924 . The discussions were between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan ( Count ) Katsura Tar\u014d on 27 July 1905 . The Japanese leader stated Japan 's reasons for its making a protectorate of Korea . He repeated that Japan had no interest in the Philippines . The US had acquired the Philippines following its victory over Spain in the Spanish \u2013 American War of 1898 . In 1924 , Tyler Dennett was the first scholar to see the document ; he described it as containing \" the text of perhaps the most remarkable ' executive agreement ' in the history of the foreign relations of the United States \" . The consensus of historians is that Dennett greatly exaggerated the importance of a routine discussion that changed nothing and set no new policies . Historians pointed out there was no formal agreement on anything new . The word \" agreement \" in the documents merely means the two sides agreed that the English and Japanese versions of the meeting notes both accurately covered the substance of the conversations . President Theodore Roosevelt later agreed that War Secretary Taft had correctly stated the American position . When Dennett first discovered the notes he assumed they indicated a highly significant \" secret pact \" between the US and Japan in creating a basis agreement whereby the two formerly isolationist nations became world powers . The conversations regarded the extent of the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States , and maintaining peace between them , in the event of victory of Japan over Russia in the Russo - Japanese War . Some Korean historians have assumed that , in the discussions , the United States recognized Japan 's sphere of influence in Korea ; in exchange , Japan recognized the United States ' sphere of influence in the Philippines . However , American historians examining official records report no agreement was ever made \u2014 the two men discussed current events but came to no new policy or agreement .

{"data_from": "redocred_test_57", "sentence": "Intelligent design ( ID ) is a pseudoscientific argument for the existence of God , presented by its proponents as \" an evidence - based scientific theory about life 's origins \" . Proponents claim that \" certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause , not an undirected process such as natural selection . \" ID is a form of creationism that lacks empirical support and offers no testable or tenable hypotheses , so it is not science . The leading proponents of ID are associated with the Discovery Institute , a fundamentalist Christian and politically conservative think tank based in the United States . Though the phrase \" intelligent design \" had featured previously in theological discussions of the design argument , the first publication of the term intelligent design in its present use as an alternative term for creationism was in Of Pandas and People , a 1989 creationist textbook intended for high school biology classes . The term was substituted into drafts of the book , directly replacing references to creation science and creationism , after the 1987 United States Supreme Court 's Edwards v. Aguillard decision , which barred the teaching of creation science in public schools on constitutional grounds . From the mid-1990s , the intelligent design movement ( IDM ) , supported by the Discovery Institute , advocated inclusion of intelligent design in public school biology curricula . This led to the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial in which U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III found that intelligent design was not science , that it \" can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents , \" and that the school district 's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . ID presents two main arguments against evolutionary explanations : irreducible complexity and specified complexity . These arguments assert that certain features ( biological and informational , respectively ) are too complex to be the result of natural processes . As a positive argument against evolution , ID proposes an analogy between natural systems and human artifacts , a version of the theological argument from design for the existence of God . ID proponents then conclude by analogy that the complex features , as defined by ID , are evidence of design . Detailed scientific examination has rebutted the claims that evolutionary explanations are inadequate , and this premise of intelligent design \u2014 that evidence against evolution constitutes evidence for design \u2014 is a false dichotomy . It is asserted that ID challenges the methodological naturalism inherent in modern science though proponents concede that they have yet to produce a scientific theory .", "relations": ["country", "country of citizenship", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "applies to jurisdiction", "has part", "publication date", "part of", "inception"], "facts": [], "right_fact_list": [], "wrong_fact_list": [], "miss_fact_list": [[["Discovery Institute", "country", "United States"]], [["John E.

{"data_from": "redocred_test_333", "sentence": "Clandestine literature , also called \" underground literature \" , refers to a type of editorial and publishing process that involves self - publishing works , often in contradiction with the legal standards of a location . Clandestine literature is often an attempt to circumvent censorship , prosecution , or other suppression . In academic study , such literature may be referred to as heterodox publications ( as opposed to officially sanctioned , orthodox publishing ) . Examples of clandestine literature include the Samizdat literature of Soviet dissidents ; the Aljamiado literature of Al - Andalus Spain ; and the nushu writing of some upper - class women in Hunan , China , from around the 10th century to the 19th century . Clandestine publications were plentiful during the Enlightenment era in 18th - century France , circulating as pamphlets or manuscripts , usually containing texts that would have been considered highly blasphemous by the Ancien R\u00e9gime , or even straight out atheist . These clandestine manuscripts particularly flourished in the 1720s , and contained such controversial works as Treatise of the Three Impostors and the reverend Jean Mesliers Atheistic Testament . Both texts were later published in edited versions by Voltaire , but handwritten manuscript copies have been found in private libraries all over Europe . The clandestine literature of 18th century France also consisted of printed works produced in neighbouring Switzerland or the Netherlands and smuggled into France . These books were usually termed \" philosophical works \" , but varied greatly in content from pornography , utopian novels , political slander and actual philosophical works by radical enlightenment philosophers like Baron d'Holbach , Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Jean - Jacques Rousseau . The willingness to break the law may be due to ideological reasons , when works are contrary to government positions or pose a threat to the institutions in power , but also for reasons at a formal level , when publications do not comply with legal regulations imposed for the circulation of printed works . Underground literature is a type of clandestine literature that does not necessarily have the evasion of the censorship of the time as its purpose ; the goal of its writers may only be to lower publishing costs , often being funded by the authors themselves . Works that are originally published by clandestine means may eventually become established as canonical literature , such as Das Kapital and El Busc\u00f3n . A legitimate publisher in one jurisdiction may assist writers from elsewhere to circumvent their own laws by enabling them to publish abroad . The Olympia Press in Paris published several 20th - century English - language writers , including Henry Miller , who were facing censorship and possible prosecution in their own country at the time .", "relations": ["languages spoken, written or signed", "country", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "country of citizenship", "continent", "contains administrative territorial entity", "location of formation"], "facts": [], "right_fact_list": [], "wrong_fact_list": [], "miss_fact_list": [[["Hunan", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "China"]], [["Hunan", "country", "China"]], [["China", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Hunan"]], [["Olympia Press", "location of formation", "Paris"]], [["Olympia Press", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Paris"]], [["Soviet", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Paris", "country", "France"]], [["Baron d'Holbach", "country of citizenship", "France"]], [["Netherlands", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Paris", "continent", "Europe"]], [["France", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Switzerland", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Henry Miller", "languages spoken, written or signed", "English"]], [["Voltaire", "country of citizenship", "France"]], [["Olympia Press", "country", "France"]], [["Julien Offray de La Mettrie", "country of citizenship", "France"]], [["Ancien R\u00e9gime", "country", "France"]], [["Al - Andalus Spain", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Paris", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "France"]], [["Olympia Press", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "France"]], [["Ancien R\u00e9gime", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "France"]]], "true_fact_list": [[["Hunan", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "China"]], [["Hunan", "country", "China"]], [["China", "contains administrative territorial entity", "Hunan"]], [["Olympia Press", "location of formation", "Paris"]], [["Olympia Press", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "Paris"]], [["Soviet", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Paris", "country", "France"]], [["Baron d'Holbach", "country of citizenship", "France"]], [["Netherlands", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Paris", "continent", "Europe"]], [["France", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Switzerland", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Henry Miller", "languages spoken, written or signed", "English"]], [["Voltaire", "country of citizenship", "France"]], [["Olympia Press", "country", "France"]], [["Julien Offray de La Mettrie", "country of citizenship", "France"]], [["Ancien R\u00e9gime", "country", "France"]], [["Al - Andalus Spain", "continent", "Europe"]], [["Paris", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "France"]], [["Olympia Press", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "France"]], [["Ancien R\u00e9gime", "located in the administrative territorial entity", "France"]]]}
